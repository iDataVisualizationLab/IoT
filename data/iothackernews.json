You build a company on relationships and the key influencer's leave and your user base is eroded. So just who is Jaiku? <p>I ran into Jaiku [0] after listening to Bruce Stirling. Bruce is a science fiction writer, appeared on the first cover of Wired and writes in his blog, <i>beyond the beyond</i> [1]. But I think he's a better orator than writer. Listening to a talk he gave at SWSX on ITConverstions [2], i found out about things like <i>spimes</i>, why the <i>'disembodied head of Alan Turing'</i> would be beaten by google and Thinklinks.<p>Thinklinks [3] allow you to locate physical things by a unique id on the Internet. The creator of Thinglinks is none other than Ulla-Maaria Mutanen [4], the other half of Jaiku creator, Jyri Engestrom [5].<p>What I've tried to demonstrate is the connected nature of communities. Any service that tries to harness their power of connections can be just as easily burnt. This episode shows demonstrates to me there is less loyalty to services than the social network you inhabit.<p>ps: news.yc can't handle unicode.<p>Reference<p>[0] Jaiku, Helsinki based , shared presence startup, 'About'<p><a href=\"http://jaiku.com/about\">http://jaiku.com/about</a><p>[1] Wired, Bruce Strirling blog, 'beyond the beyond'<p><a href=\"http://blog.wired.com/sterling/\">http://blog.wired.com/sterling/</a><p>[2] ITConversations, 'Bruce Stirling, The Internet of Things, 58m, 26.4 mb, 2006MAR06'<p><a href=\"http://www.itconversations.com/shows/detail717.html\">http://www.itconversations.com/shows/detail717.html</a><p>[3] Thinklink, 'locate physical things by computers.

As a current App.net customer/user, I was very confused about the original announcement because the idea has nothing whatsoever to do with the current App.net product. So now I am worried that App.net as I understand it today might go away if you head in this new direction (I see in the FAQ you will support the current product for a year).<p>On the one hand, I am over Twitter. Done. It is way too noisy now, and I have been severely burned by their dev ecosystem. I put in so much time and effort (naively, I admit), and the aftertaste is super bitter. You and I have talked about this before at length, so I won't go into detail. That level of ecosystem-scorching has made me hesitant to put a lot of time and effort into something new and similar. This may be unfounded since I know you are wanting to do the right thing by your developers, but still the soreness remains and affects my judgement.<p>There are other non-ad-supported systems for this type of communication out there. Some are federated (status.net), some are not (heello.com). You and I both watched the immediate demise and shaming of heello. How will this be different? Perhaps it is the pay-to-play nature that will keep the trolls out at the start.<p>On the other hand, I can see where this would be very useful if it was in fact implemented correctly as an actual real-time feed platform. Using a combination of webhooks (pubsubhubbub) and data-streams (e.g. twitter streaming API), this could be a really powerful platform for developers, builders, and makers to finally bring about The Internet of Things that many have been dreaming about. I am worried that this is such a niche desire of a few inventive hackers that there won't be enough support behind it to sustain it as a centralized company (however, I don't see how an open, federated system is sustainable in this fashion either, so).<p>I know you are very passionate about this problem. We've discussed it before. I know this is something that you want to see exist, and so as a fellow builder and maker you are insanely driven to see it become a reality. I understand this drive.

Entrepreneurs have the benefit of being able to look for and solve important problems in <i>any field</i>.  And what makes a problem important?  Here's how you adapt Hamming's essay on important pure science into important design work:<p><i>What makes a problem important? It\u2019s not the end result: responsive web design provides a new way to build sites, but it\u2019s not the only way. Rather, importance is a factor of</i> solubility: <i>important problems are answerable, if only you could connect the right dots. Important problems advance understanding. Marcotte figured out how to unify design rhetoric across many devices, but he probably didn\u2019t know he was going to get there when he started in 2009: the iPad didn\u2019t exist yet, and neither his articles nor his book mention \u201ciPhone\u201d or \u201cmobile\u201d or even just \u201cphone\u201d in a relevant context.</i><p><i>You can't know exactly what field to work in, but you can stay active in places where something might happen. Maybe these places are where the work is diligent rather than sexy \u2013 like documenting the history of interaction design, saving rare hardware, or preserving old books. Maybe they are social and cultural, like educating designers on the value of professional practices, designing supportive professional societies, and building tools for study. Or maybe the future will be built on defining best practices for future tools and their interactions.

Broad experience was just as important as technical chops.<p><i>If you do not work on an important problem, it's unlikely you'll do important work. It's perfectly obvious. Great scientists have thought through, in a careful way, a number of important problems in their field, and they keep an eye on wondering how to attack them. Let me warn you, \"important problem\" must be phrased carefully. The three outstanding problems in physics, in a certain sense, were never worked on while I was at Bell Labs. By important I mean guaranteed a Nobel Prize and any sum of money you want to mention. We didn't work on (1) time travel, (2) teleportation, and (3) antigravity. They are not important problems because we do not have an attack. It's not the consequence that makes a problem important, it is that you have a reasonable attack. That is what makes a problem important. When I say that most scientists don't work on important problems, I mean it in that sense. The average scientist, so far as I can make out, spends almost all his time working on problems which he believes will not be important and he also doesn't believe that they will lead to important problems.</i><p>I tackle important problems for designers in my recent essay, You and Your Designs, published in this quarter's issue of Distance: <a href=\"http://distance.cc/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://distance.cc/</a><p>I give examples of five important problems in design, and explain why:<p>1. Responsive web design, because it exposes content and content management as a first-order design constraint.<p>2. A/B testing, because intentionally and purposefully trying different things goes against how many of us were raised as designers.<p>3. The Internet of Things, because it means we can do away with metaphors and have physical objects that contain their own meaning.<p>4. \"Big data\" and \"computational X,\" because they represent the event horizon for designer-as-polymath.<p>5. \"Immersive I/O\" and \"natural user interfaces,\" because they remove our \"sensory deprived and physically limited\" constraints on interactions with technology.<p>I wrote in a different comment elsewhere, the interesting thing about entrepreneurship is, <i>you don't have to be limited by your field of academic research, and your lunch tables of chemists and mathematicians can be those of any industry in the world.

It worked out of the box, and the community forum answered most of my questions.  Overall, the web browsing performance and UI has too many problems to be usable as a PC.  I bought it to explore using Android as a platform for IOT and other such projects and unfortunately, it fell down here as well because it has no GPIO interface to drive other hardware including LEDs, LCD displays, sensors, IR devices, motors, etc.  Further, Google did a great job of addressing this requirement with Android by releasing the ADK of 2011 which provides built in integration with Arduino via a USB ADB interface, but the ADK requires Android 3.1 or higher.<p>Looking at the Paper's new faster performance, the addition of GPIOs, and Android 4.0, and an optional case, it is clear that VIA has been listening to user feedback.  They certainly delivered on my wishlist.  In the end the 8750 was a $65 lesson on how far Android has come in such a short period of time.<p>Android applications are excellent, so while I see plenty of complaints about what it doesn't have, it is certainly getting the developer attention necessary for applications that can / will replace productivity applications on Windows machines.  For the 80%, the desktop is nearly dead.<p>Further, Android is a great platform for embedded applications, and it looks like APC has delivered an inexpensive platform for the maker / hacker community.<p>Though a direct comparison to RPi is unfair, an APC comes with a power supply and 4GB of flash, so I consider a  Raspberry Pi to actually cost $75:\n$45 (Actual street price of a Pi)\n$15 Memory Card\n$15 for a decent USB power supply (a low quality PS causes many of the RPi stability and Ext4 corruption issues I have seen on forums).  \n(Also, Android is preloaded, so it is a much lower effort to get running.)<p>And the comment about fire made me laugh.  The CPU of the 8750 might have reached 40 degrees under very heavy load and the power supply is external, so cardboard certainly won't be an issue.  I thought it was funny because I actually use the cardboard box the 8750 comes in because it is virtually impossible to find a Neo-ITX case for the board.<p>Hope that provides some insight.

There is a lot of food for thought in the full responses of the persons who respond to the Edge questions each year.<p>For example, one of the responses is just plain puzzling in the blogspam tl;dr version, but thought-provoking in the full version:<p>\"Steven Strogatz<p>\"Professor of Applied Mathematics, Cornell University; Author, The Joy of x<p>\"Too Much Coupling<p>\"In every realm where we exist as a collective \u2014in society, in the global economy, on the Internet \u2014we are blithely increasing the coupling between us, with no idea what that might entail.<p>\"'Coupling' refers to the ability of one part of a complex system to influence another. If I put a hundred metronomes on the floor and set them ticking, they'll each do their own thing, swinging at their own rhythm. In this condition, they're not yet coupled. Because the floor is rigid, the metronomes can't feel each other's vibrations, at least not enough to make a difference. But now place them all on a movable platform like the seat of a child's swing. The metronomes will start to feel each other's jiggling. The swing will start to sway, imperceptibly at first, but enough to disturb each metronome and alter its rhythm. Eventually the whole system will synchronize, with all the metronomes ticking in unison. By allowing the metronomes to impose themselves on each other through the vibrations they impart to the movable platform, we have coupled the system and changed its dynamics radically.<p>\"In all sorts of complex systems, this is the general trend: increasing the coupling between the parts seems harmless enough at first. But then, abruptly, when the coupling crosses a critical value, everything changes. The exact nature of the altered state isn't easy to foretell. It depends on the system's details. But it's always something qualitatively different from what came before. Sometimes desirable, sometimes deadly.<p>\"I worry that we're playing the coupling game with ourselves, collectively. With our cell phones and GPS trackers and social media, with globalization, with the coming Internet of things, we're becoming more tightly connected than ever. Of course, maybe that's good. Greater coupling means faster and easier communication and sharing. We can often do more together than apart.<p>\"But the math suggests that increasing coupling is a siren's song. Too much makes a complex system brittle. In economics and business, the wisdom of the crowd works only if the individuals within it are independent, or nearly so. Loosely coupled crowds are the only wise ones.<p>\"The human brain is the most exquisitely coupled system we know of, but the coupling between different brain areas has been honed by evolution to allow for the subtleties of attention, memory, perception, and consciousness. Too much coupling produces pathological synchrony: the rhythmic convulsions and loss of consciousness associated with epileptic seizures.<p>\"Propagating malware, worldwide pandemics, flash crashes\u2014all symptoms of too much coupling. Unfortunately it's hard to predict how much coupling is too much. We only know that we want more, and that more is better\u2026 until it isn't.\"", "parent": 5659087.0, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": null, "id": 5659185, "ranking": null, "date": 1367777769000, "year": 2013}, {"by": "darinlhammond", "score": 1.0, "time": 1367961881, "timestamp": 1367961881000, "title": "The Internet of Things is taking over the world: An Introduction", "type": "story", "url": "http://www.zipminis.com/36/post/2013/05/the-internet-of-things-is-taking-over-the-world-an-introduction-to-what-you-must-know.html#", "text": "", "parent": null, "deleted": null, "dead": true, "descendants": -1.0, "id": 5670903, "ranking": null, "date": 1367961881000, "year": 2013}, {"by": "benwerd", "score": 5.0, "time": 1367988378, "timestamp": 1367988378000, "title": "SapphireOS: open source mesh network OS for Internet of Things", "type": "story", "url": "http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1286098094/wirelessly-connect-all-the-things-with-sapphire", "text": "", "parent": null, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": 0.0, "id": 5672541, "ranking": null, "date": 1367988378000, "year": 2013}, {"by": "scholia", "score": 3.0, "time": 1368033544, "timestamp": 1368033544000, "title": "Connecting Things to the Internet Does Not an Internet of Things Make", "type": "story", "url": "http://allthingsd.com/20130508/connecting-things-to-the-internet-does-not-an-internet-of-things-make/", "text": "", "parent": null, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": 0.0, "id": 5675491, "ranking": null, "date": 1368033544000, "year": 2013}, {"by": "lenazegher", "score": null, "time": 1368173277, "timestamp": 1368173277000, "title": "", "type": "comment", "url": "", "text": "<p><pre><code>    The so-called \"Internet of things\" adds another wrinkle.

Even for the more general server-side development, the Node software library is growing fast, but it is very, very thin and represents a tiny fraction of the JavaScript software world.<p>&gt; it&#x27;s not clear to me really what the use cases for this device are, other than that it&#x27;s a way to run javascript on hardware, and some people might want that.<p>Yeah, and even from that context, if you went with a JVM runtime, you&#x27;d have JavaScript (admittedly not quite as nice as with V8, but still enough for most people who&#x27;d want to play around with an embedded JavaScript server) along with a plethora of other languages to choose from, which I&#x27;d have to think would do a much better job of getting a broader selection of web developers <i>started</i> in the &quot;Internet of Things&quot; paradigm.<p>&gt; My goal was, initially, to just try to turn the conversation away from language wars toward actually discussing the device. and its merits. I have clearly failed.<p>Hehe. Well, responding to questions about the language choice can do that. ;-)<p>That said, I <i>will</i> ask that question: there are lots of other efforts to package up Cortex-M microservers for sensornets and ad-hoc devicenets and bundle them with user-friendly API&#x27;s. I haven&#x27;t been able to discern what&#x27;s particularly exciting about this approach. What do you think is uniquely interesting about this solution?<p>&gt; over time you revealed that you believe that being able to deal natively with binary protocols is a core feature of a language suited for hardware.<p>&quot;core feature&quot; means different things to different people. I look at it as a building block that a lot of core functionality for working with devices tends to build on top of, and a very important tool to have in your back pocket when dealing with a legacy device with lord only knows what fun little protocol bugs^H^H^H^Hquirks. It&#x27;s not that you <i>have</i> to have it, but not having it tends to discourage the rich development of that larger ecosystem, and in JavaScript&#x27;s case I&#x27;ve had first hand experience with it.<p>&gt; it is a core feature of node.js, which is the api this hardware device purports to emulate. node.js is a kind of defacto standard at this point, which is good enough.<p>Agreed. My main problem is &quot;good enough&quot; is not exactly the kind of quality that makes me say, &quot;oh yeah, we obviously should choose this one&quot;. If someone hands me a Node.js server and says, &quot;talk to this air pressure sensor&quot;, I&#x27;m not going to say, &quot;it can&#x27;t be done&quot; because obviously it can be done, and without having to move mountains. But if I&#x27;d not been handed anything other problem of talking to the air pressure sensor, even if I was looking to bring on a ton of web developers with little or no familiarity working with hardware, Node.js wouldn&#x27;t exactly have sprung to the top of my mind. ;-)<p>&gt; To my knowledge there are no standards documents for lua, python or ruby and people have no problem using those languages.<p>There are no EMCA-like standards bodies for those languages, but there are documents defining the language (though Ruby in particular seems to have a bit of the, &quot;however the runtime works&quot; mentality it is still shrugging off). That actually has been an impediment from time to time, though obviously not a huge one.<p>Lua&#x27;s language is quite detailed about bindings to the native platform and even has a specific type, &quot;userdata&quot; for unmanaged blobs of memory, and Lua&#x27;s deceptively named &quot;string&quot; type holds an 8-bit clean arbitrary set of random bytes, so not only are its &quot;string functions&quot; and IO libraries naturally capable of byte-oriented processing, there&#x27;s little friction for even ancillary libraries supporting and exploiting it. Ruby&#x27;s string implementation is similar.<p>Python has, as far back as I can recall, had support for binary IO and processing, though I&#x27;d qualify that by saying it has been somewhat hokey, though things like structs and Cython have helped mitigate it. Until 2.7.x and 3.x.x came around, I&#x27;d give Python demerits in this area, though not as bad as JavaScript.<p>&gt; So what else is there that gives you the willies?<p>As I mentioned, there&#x27;s the probabilistic parser. When you are learning it is nice to have forgiveness, but it is much better to have each and every mistake pointed out to you. A probabilistic parser makes things less transparent. That can be worth it if you&#x27;re going with a &quot;do what you can&quot; mentality that makes perfect sense for web documents, but with hardware imprecise communications are just as wrong as incorrect ones. This doesn&#x27;t mean a language need be hard, it just means that you want to be painfully clear about what is and isn&#x27;t correct from day one.<p>Then there&#x27;s JavaScript&#x27;s bizarre and limited approach to arithmetic. Java&#x27;s lack of unsigned fixed point arithmetic has drawn some deserved criticism, but those concerns seem puny when compared to JavaScript&#x27;s quantum numbers that exhibit double&#x2F;int32 duality. Not a good can of worms to open up, particularly when talking to hardware that might (per Murphy: read will) have odd numerical representations of its own. Even if you assume numbers are passing back and forth as decimal arithmetic strings, that&#x27;s a Pandora&#x27;s Box of fun just waiting to be opened that isn&#x27;t going to make the experience any easier even for programmers fairly familiar with JavaScript.<p>Then there&#x27;s the whole async I&#x2F;O, event driven callback model. While I personally love that model, and at first glance it seems like it&#x27;d be a perfect match for sensors and devicenets, it does come with some downsides. It&#x27;s a less natural paradigm for a lot of more novice programmers, and the way it decouples logic and injects layers of indirection in to the code can lead to confused developers when tackling new paradigms. Coroutines seem to present an initially more accessible approach to that model, and the thread model is initially often much more approachable for developers (though the popularity of Java NIO is an obvious testament to advantages of getting comfortable with I&#x2F;O state machines sooner rather than later).<p>So there&#x27;s some more straight forward concerns.

I don&#x27;t spend my life working on them but I&#x27;ve installed them for student tenants, thinking I was doing a great thing and maybe preventing them from killing themselves with an unattended cooking fire, and you know what, two months later when I went around every single one, every single flat I manage, had knocked their alarms down. Every single one. I wanted to slap the stupid fucks, but then I realised that hey, most people really are kinda lazy and stupid and you will get nowhere getting angry over that fact, you have to accept that and adapt as best you can.<p>At the time I imagined something very similar to Nest - an alarm over your oven which turns it off if it detects sudden heat. An alarm which sends me, the property manager, a text if it goes off. An alarm that can distinguish too between &quot;a little smoke&quot; and &quot;a shitload of smoke and heat.&quot; I imagined that, and I talked to the local fire service, and they laughed and shrugged and said it&#x27;d be great but who&#x27;s gunna do that.<p>And now guess what, here&#x27;s a company that&#x27;s actually made and prepping to sell something even better than what I thought about. It&#x27;s a beautiful looking object, for starters. It talks to you in intelligent language - &quot;there&#x27;s carbon monoxide in the living room&quot;. It distinguishes between potentially dangerous and critically dangerous situations. It can send push notifications to your phone when something goes wrong or when batteries are about to go out. It can be silenced with an elegant hand gesture. And it gets better: it lights up a room when it sees you walking through it at night. It can turn off your furnace if CO levels rise, if its connected to Nest&#x27;s Thermostat. And it will help your Thermostat get smarter about power usage by detecting your activity.<p>And this is just a version one product. Keep in mind - the name is &quot;Protect&quot;, not &quot;Smoke Detector.&quot; What&#x27;s to stop them making v2 smarter, and maybe it can sense when people in a house become panicked and call emergency services? Maybe it detects unusual activity when burglars enter? Whatever - use your imagination - the possibilities are huge. And don&#x27;t forget, this is only the second product that Nest has produced. And already with two they&#x27;ve made them better together. This is the Internet of Things man. It&#x27;s happening, and it&#x27;s going to be massive.<p>If you&#x27;re not seeing the breakthrough yet, then I just don&#x27;t know what to say to you. What, are you angry because they made such a good product? Because they&#x27;re selling it for a fraction of what it&#x27;s worth? Because they&#x27;re smarter than any of the unimaginative companies making crappy smoke alarms we had to put up with up until today? Are you angry because it&#x27;s &quot;not enough&quot;? Because the whole world&#x27;s not going to run out and buy this one product tomorrow, and so therefore for some weird reasons we shouldn&#x27;t bothered being excited about it, because obviously it&#x27;s gunna go nowhere?<p>Get over yourself man.

The privacy&#x2F;4th amendment movement is going to have to plan for advocating higher risks, more freedom, more liberty, combined with more laws about privacy, along with determining how to build change in mindset over time (it&#x27;s called propaganda or, more politely, marketing). Privacy implications need to be worked out, discussed, brought to light in fiction, philosophy, law, debates, etc. The mindset of fear and &quot;never again&quot; and &quot;risk is unacceptable&quot; has to be broken in order to make mass surveillance a non-starter.<p>Worse -   The reality is that privacy is going to be dead with the Internet of Things coming online. The question is, what is acceptable and legal to monitor and record? For myself, I believe that we need to have stringent personal data laws forcing deletion of consumer data unless required for a service, as well as requiring warrants for any data collection not already given to the government (i.e., irs filing).<p>The 2nd Amendment groups are in this for the long run.  I don&#x27;t see how the privacy groups can afford to do otherwise.<p>edit: I would enjoy discussing this with interested parties, particularly activists and activist-leaning people.

In my case, photo backups from my phone to my laptop, which happens via PhotoStream at the moment, or files from my laptop to my phone. If a route can easily be formed across the nearest AP then it&#x27;s shorter, more stable, probably higher bandwidth and certainly lower latency than via the cloud.  As the number of devices I own grows, this use case will become more prevalent (think &quot;Internet of Things&quot;).<p><i>&quot;You have to do a lot more work to achieve things that would otherwise be simple and straightforward&quot;</i>: Sure, but you haven&#x27;t asked <i>why</i> this is the case (and who &#x27;you&#x27; is), which is just as important to examine. At the moment, you <i>as a developer</i> have to do more work in order to build decentralised systems because not enough <i>free OSS tools exist yet</i>.  The main reason that using a central server is easier is because the tools, techniques and knowledgebase have become &#x27;standardised&#x27; but that doesn&#x27;t preclude there being <i>better</i> ways of doing things.  I&#x27;m advocating tools that make it easier to build decentralised services and products.<p>Decentralised systems are more resilient than their centralised counterparts. Any large-scale service&#x2F;product ends up being decentralised behind the scenes and if you don&#x27;t believe me, ponder for a moment how the likes of Google, Facebook et. al., manage to deal with so many users across the globe.  They <i>have</i> to make their own tools to solve the same kinds of problems I&#x27;m alluding to. I&#x27;m merely advocating that we try to &#x27;productize&#x27; such tools so that any developer can pick them up and incorporate them from the very beginning.  Real world examples of such things are how Skype worked in the early days, Dropbox&#x27;s LAN sync [1] and even Spotify [2], where P2P can improve user experience and <i>reduce</i> their bandwidth costs. I don&#x27;t know how their systems work but this clearly demonstrates the business value in P2P.<p>As you say yourself, <i>&quot;the internet is already a system of decentralized networks and services&quot;</i> but don&#x27;t dismiss the work taken to get there and the value that the lack of centralisation brings. Those same benefits can be gained elsewhere provided the appropriate tools&#x2F;infrastructure are made available and useable.<p>Hypothesis: If there were FOSS tools that make it easier to create secure, decentralised systems, more developers would create secure, decentralised products.<p>[1] <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/help/137/en\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dropbox.com&#x2F;help&#x2F;137&#x2F;en</a><p>[2] <a href=\"http://community.spotify.com/t5/Help-Desktop-Linux-Mac-and/Unadvertised-P2P-feature/m-p/400160#M46512\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;community.spotify.com&#x2F;t5&#x2F;Help-Desktop-Linux-Mac-and&#x2F;U...</a>", "parent": 6922842.0, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": null, "id": 6923642, "ranking": null, "date": 1387311607000, "year": 2013}, {"by": "meldehi", "score": 1.0, "time": 1387340656, "timestamp": 1387340656000, "title": "How I am waking up in the \u2018internet of things\u2019 era, in a more \u201cnatural\u201d way", "type": "story", "url": "https://medium.com/p/b8b2d741910a", "text": "", "parent": null, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": 0.0, "id": 6925890, "ranking": null, "date": 1387340656000, "year": 2013}, {"by": "JacksonBond", "score": 2.0, "time": 1387376393, "timestamp": 1387376393000, "title": "A tasty looking chocolate bar for the Internet of Things", "type": "story", "url": "http://beekn.net/2013/12/ibeacon-my-love-is-like-chocolate-for-the-internet-of-things/", "text": "", "parent": null, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": 2.0, "id": 6927586, "ranking": null, "date": 1387376393000, "year": 2013}, {"by": "pygy_", "score": null, "time": 1387392635, "timestamp": 1387392635000, "title": "", "type": "comment", "url": "", "text": "Corporations are still human-oriented.<p>Another scary thing is the combination of the internet of things that is currently taking shape, and the fact that a lot of computer systems are backdoored by governments.<p>Nice attack vector for smart software (not counting accidental vulnerabilities).", "parent": 6929089.0, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": null, "id": 6929635, "ranking": null, "date": 1387392635000, "year": 2013}, {"by": "ddmma", "score": 2.0, "time": 1387466320, "timestamp": 1387466320000, "title": "Data sharing in the Internet of things", "type": "story", "url": "http://dasdata.co", "text": "", "parent": null, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": 0.0, "id": 6935073, "ranking": null, "date": 1387466320000, "year": 2013}, {"by": "jonb", "score": null, "time": 1387668025, "timestamp": 1387668025000, "title": "", "type": "comment", "url": "", "text": "2014 will be the &quot;internet of things&quot; (Bluetooth LE) and wearables will be a subset of it.", "parent": 6947643.0, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": null, "id": 6948519, "ranking": null, "date": 1387668025000, "year": 2013}, {"by": "pfraze", "score": null, "time": 1387729616, "timestamp": 1387729616000, "title": "", "type": "comment", "url": "", "text": "The async api bit is pretty off for a couple of reasons.<p>1.

We were broken into in October 2012. The big fear as we waited outside for the police to say we could enter (they dusted for prints) was that we&#x27;d lose photos of our kids. They took laptops, but not the backups. I now have offsite backups.<p>Security is an antiquated industry. I went with Simplisafe.com.  It&#x27;s a self-installed system, it uses wireless over t-mobile to call home. It has a 24&#x2F;7 call center monitoring the alarm and they do call 911 quickly. I know this bc we had a few false alarms after installing.<p>Simplisafe has great service and there is no contract, but as a practical reality you don&#x27;t have many choices in the space anyway. So yeah, you can cancel, but there&#x27;s not too many places to go. You can also buy a brinks&#x2F;ADT yard sign on eBay, since to my mind that&#x27;s scarier than a startup most thieves haven&#x27;t heard of.<p>The only part of home security Simplisafe reinvents is the installation. I thought they were coming out with a networked fire alarm, but they&#x27;re not moving to be a total home automation or internet of things play. You can&#x27;t add third party hardware, like the Foscam or GE home automation stuff I have. I see why Simplisafe doesn&#x27;t want to just support any HW, since the result of a false positive is their call center calling the police .<p>I am not a fan of their motion sensors. That was the cause of both false alarms. It wasn&#x27;t the cat, they later told us that the air mass coming out of forced air heating looks like a person. This is a big deal and I screamed at them for not disclosing this. The police where I live are very helpful, and we cried wolf twice. The first time, the neighbor unlocked the door and an officer entered our home gun drawn. That must&#x27;ve been incredibly tramautic for that officer. And of course we were fined twice.<p>Hang in there. That first night, my family slept w&#x2F; the neighbors. I was at Home Depot and a man starting his late night shift cut a perfect piece of plywood for me. I used it to board up our broken door like you might before a hurricane. I was so grateful to have that help, to have the help of police, and neighbors.

It tries to explain social phenomena in terms of how &quot;actors&quot; -- both humans and nonhumans -- interact in networks.<p>ANT is a popular approach among sociologists who study scientific and technological developments, but it&#x27;s also highly controversial because it sees nonhuman things as being just as integral to the network as humans are. Instead of humans <i>using</i> phones to produce various social phenomena, for example, humans and phones act together according to ANT. As if phones had a volition of their own. Critics of ANT argue that this is nonsense. Proponents of ANT reply that you don&#x27;t need to have your own will in order to participate meaningfully in a social network.<p>For most of human history, it seemed that people simply <i>used</i> things to get what they want. The things in question were too simple, often no more than a chunk of rock. Surely the interaction between ancient populations was much more interesting than their interaction with rocks? But even in the stone age, those simple tools had a tremendous effect on the fate of the humans who wielded them, so it&#x27;s often useful for historians and anthropologists to ask how things <i>interacted with</i> people, instead of just asking how people <i>used</i> them <i>in</i> their interaction with one another. It&#x27;s a useful change of perspectives, a different algorithm perhaps, that yields interesting theorerical insights.<p>But now it seems like ANT might be more than a novelty method. It could actually be a <i>substantially better</i> perspective than the traditional alternatives. More and more &quot;things&quot; are becoming &quot;smart&quot;. They are no longer being unilaterally used by us; they use us too, and are in turn used by others. They get a life of their own and adapt to completely unforseen uses. They are reused and abused; in turn, they reuse and abuse the information we feed them. As long as you have an IP address, it doesn&#x27;t matter whether you have a brain or a CPU. You exchange information as equals, you process them, and you propagate your results to the rest of the network.<p>Perhaps the fundamental relationship between us and our tools hasn&#x27;t changed at all. But if so, the emergence of the Internet of Things and Humans makes it much easier for us to <i>recognize</i> that we never really unilaterally used anything after all. Nothing in nature unilaterally uses anything else.

With Printoo, you can make a prototype using electrochromic displays to tell you how long you have before boarding and&#x2F;or how far away you are from your gate. You can have printed batteries powering the system. You can have Bluetooth for positioning and synch with the servers. It&#x27;s not going to look exactly like a boarding pass, but it&#x27;ll be a much closer approximation than would be possible with any other proto board and it will use technologies that would make sense for that.

Look how &quot;vulnerable&quot; credit cards are, every time you use with a new vendor, you increase the risk that one of those vendors will take all your money.

This is beyond government surveillance, and the rules and regulations about (a) privacy of one&#x27;s datasphere, and (b) the terms of access (much given away via the &quot;I accept&quot; button on apps) are not in place.

The most problematic area here is service providers who have to assess risk (car, health, house insurance). We are already seeing denial of service to individuals, based on access to one&#x27;s personal datasphere (e.g. cardio wrist band data resulting in denial of travel insurance).

So, US Census needed a better tool.  Enter H. Hollerith who borrowed the idea of punched cards from, maybe, the Jacquard loom.<p>Tom Watson was with National Cash Register or some such, saw the Hollerith equipment, concluded that it was the \nsecret to automating routine business record keeping, especially accounting, and IBM was born.<p>Watson sold the heck out of his equipment.  And he had\na team of good electro-mechanical engineers in\nPoughkeepsie designing and building the equipment.\nThat takes us to about 1960.  They made a lot of money.<p>About then, Tom Watson, Jr. visited Columbia University\nand reported that there was a guy there\ndoing things, whatever, 200,000 times a second.<p>An IBM life insurance customer in NYC complained\nthat the IBM punched cards were taking up too much\nroom.  So, some changes were needed, e.g.,\nmagnetic tape.<p>Due to US WWII work on vacuum tube digital computers\nand pushed by Univac, IBM got into the computer business,\nwith magnetic tape, software, etc.<p>In the late 1950s Watson was told that he had\nno research division and that to have a good one\nhe needed a leader good researchers would respect.\nSo, Watson got a chunk a land in Westchester County,\nNY and hired Eero Saarinen to build him a fancy \nresearch lab on a hill near Yorktown Heights.<p>By the mid 1960s, IBM had an idea, a line of\ncompatible computers called System 360 (the\norigin of the IBM &#x27;mainframe&#x27; computers).  So,\na customer could start\nwith a cheap, small, slow System 360&#x2F;20, 30, 40, etc. and\nwhen ran out of capacity upgrade to a 360&#x2F;50, 65, 85, 91,\n95, etc. and just keep running the same software.<p>IBM regarded itself not as an electronics company\nor a computer company but a marketing company.\nThe marketing&#x2F;sales people had nearly all the power.<p>Here the focus was still on routine business record\nkeeping, &#x27;business machines&#x27;, and not general purpose\ncomputing.  IBM had some good work in general purpose\ncomputing, but the executives stayed with their &#x27;good IBM customers&#x27;.  So, when MIT did Multics in 1969,\nIBM was slow to respond.  When DEC was selling good\ngeneral purpose\ntime sharing on the DEC 10, IBM was slow to respond.<p>As a means of a time-sharing computer \nto be used for developing operating systems,\nIBM Cambridge Scientific Center did\nCP67&#x2F;CMS for the IBM 360&#x2F;67 virtual memory computer \nof about 1967 and where CP67 was virtual machine.\nLots of people loved CP67&#x2F;CMS, later VM&#x2F;CMS,\nbut IBM&#x27;s marketing people didn&#x27;t want to sell it.\nInternally, VM&#x2F;CMS ran the company\nthrough at least 1994.  Also there was VNET,\nroughly like the Internet except the\ncomputers were also the routers --\ndid essentially of the IBM internal\ncomputing through at least 1994.  Use it?\nYes.  Eagerly sell it?  No.  &#x27;Dog fooding&#x27;?  No.<p>In the 1970s,\nIBM did move to System 370, a &#x27;mainframe&#x27; which had virtual memory.\nCustomers wanted to do interactive, on-line \napplications, and IBM responded slowly.\nFor the communications, IBM did \nSystems Network Architecture, which\nwas about as flexible and easy to install as a railroad\nand about as costly.  IBM did notice that\nwith much in on-line activity, they could\nsell a lot more System 370 computers and did.<p>IBM was slow to let the capacity of the 370\ncomputers increase as quickly as customers\nwanted, but by 1980 IBM had\na collection of faster boxes.\nAs 18 wheel trucks lined up to\nreceive these computers, the\nline backed up to the\nNYS Thruway, and there was a\nblip in the US GDP.<p>A lot of IBM customers were doing\n&#x27;personal productivity&#x27;,\ne.g., word processing and electronic\nspreadsheets, on IBM&#x27;s mainframe computers.<p>But that was 1980, and DEC,\nData General, Prime and others\nwere doing well.  Prime\nwas a single board, bit-sliced,\nvirtual memory computer with\nsome extra register sets for\nfast process switching\nand a darned efficient time sharing\nbox, much more efficient, and much\neasier to use, than anything from IBM.\nAnd in 1980, Prime gave the best\nROI on the NYSE.<p>Also about here came the microprocessors,\ne.g., Intel 8080 and 8086.  Then\nPCs began to explode.  Then work\nstarted moving off IBM&#x27;s mainframes.\nBy 1986 or so, DEC was getting more\nrevenue from DuPont than IBM was.<p>There were well done IBM internal\nreports on technology and markets\nthat outlined the future and the\nthreats to IBM&#x27;s business, but\nIBM&#x27;s leadership, really successful\nmainframe salesmen, essentially\nignored the reports.\nThe mainframe people had the \npower and worked to kill off\nanything else inside IBM.<p>At one time, IBM CEO Gerstner\nsaid that &quot;IBM is the most\narrogant, \ninwardly directed,\nprocess oriented\ncompany I&#x27;ve every seen.&quot;.<p>By 1986, at an internal top management\nmeeting, it was possible to go around\nthe table and find that nearly no\none had made their projections.\nThe conclusion was that God \nhad ceased to smile on IBM.<p>IBM laughed at Intel and Microsoft,\nand those two came to have by far\nthe last laugh.<p>For a while IBM&#x27;s Cocke&#x27;s\nwork on reduced instruction\nset computing (RISC) gave IBM\nan opportunity to grab the\nhigh end desktop and workstation\nmarkets, e.g., for finance,\nengineering design, graphics,\nbut the mainframe people didn&#x27;t\nlike the competition.  E.g.,\nwhen an IBM mainframe had a\nprocessor clock of about 10 MHz,\nCocke&#x27;s discrete component board\nwith RISC had a clock of 80 MHz.<p>Near 1994, IBM in three years\nIBM lost $16 billion\nand went from ~400,000 employees\ndown to ~200,000.  The research\ndivision phone book went from\n4500 names down to 1500\nwith about 500 of those recent temporary\nemployees.<p>Then IBM pushed services,\ne.g., they would run\nyour data center for you.<p>IBM bought companies with attractive products and put the\nIBM marketing force behind those\nproducts.<p>Net, the first and last &#x27;visionary&#x27;\nthing IBM did was to grab\nHollerith&#x27;s work, although, of course,\nit was Hollerith who was the real visionary.\nSince then IBM has focused\non selling &#x27;business machines&#x27; for\nroutine business record keeping\nfor large banks, insurance companies,\nmanufacturing companies,\nand governments.\nThat&#x27;s their &#x27;market&#x27;.\nThey haven&#x27;t tried very hard\nto look for other markets.\nIn technology, IBM lets others\ntake the first steps and\nmaybe does something similar or\nmaybe just buys a company.\nThat&#x27;s what they are still doing.<p>IBM had a lot of opportunities they\njust dropped, apparently deliberately:<p>They could easily have had all of Cisco,\nIntel, Microsoft, and Oracle.  At one time, they\nran NSFNet, that is, the Internet;\nhad IBM stayed with that work, they could\nhave be running some huge fraction of all of\nthe Internet.  IBM\nwas long a leader in laser printing, \ne.g., for printing bank statements on\na roll of paper moved with a fork lift truck,\nbut\nin the US HP made big bucks in that market.  In the 1980s IBM saw the\nneed for video servers and had some working;\nsame for wearable computing.  For the\nInternet of things, IBM has long had the\nTCP&#x2F;IP stack on a chip.  For relational database,\nIBM invented it, roughly parallel to E. Wong&#x27;s work\nat Berkeley, but now the revenue for\nrelational database goes to, right, Oracle, etc.\nIBM did early work on the tricky \n&#x27;passive&#x27; amplifier wrap around an optical\nfiber to amplify the digital signal\nwithout converting from optical to\nelectrical; likely that amplifier is\ncrucial for the backbone of the Internet,\nbut IBM is not running that backbone;\nmaybe IBM is getting some patent license\nrevenue.\nIBM did good, early \nwork on giant magneto resistive \ndisk heads and associated vertical\nrecording and long was the leader\nin magnetic disk, but now people\nbuy hard disk drives from\nSeagate, Western Digital, Maxtor, etc.\nIBM did a lot of high end work on\nlarge disk storage systems,\nbut people buy from EMC, build their own, etc.\nIt goes on and on:  At one time or another,\nIBM had in their lap the beginnings of nearly everything\nwe see today in information technology but\ndropped it.<p>IBM remains focused on being a\n&#x27;marketing&#x27; company, but now they\nare a bit short on what to market.<p>Ah, yet another mainframe salesman\nbites the dust.", "parent": 7847507.0, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": null, "id": 7849913, "ranking": null, "date": 1401936202000, "year": 2014}, {"by": "nebulus", "score": null, "time": 1401937151, "timestamp": 1401937151000, "title": "", "type": "comment", "url": "", "text": "Does this problem (the growing widespread network insecurity of everyday objects) have a specific name, like &quot;security rot&quot;?

An LED light show is a trifle, it&#x27;s not something that will really affect you in any way <i>and it&#x27;s already possible with current technology</i>.

I am not sure I understand the question?<p>I was mostly referring to the LEDs-wall, thing, which isn&#x27;t inherently a <i>networking</i> problem any more than addressing each pixel in a television is a networking problem. If you&#x27;re building a wall of LEDs for &quot;light shows&quot;, chances are you&#x27;ll just connect them all to a single controller anyway which can individually address each LED &quot;pixel&quot;, and then that controller will be either plugged into your &quot;internet of things&quot; or it will be controlled by some physical panel.<p>The two big advantages of device connectivity are going to be that you don&#x27;t have to be in the same room as your device to mess with it (not having to get up basically doesn&#x27;t count, because we already have remote controls for almost everything), and that your interface with a device can be much, much more robust (you can essentially use your tablet or phone to give a full touch-screen UX to a small, cheap device like a coffee maker or a lightbulb). The first advantage seems to be getting a lot of hype because people can mess with things at home from when they are out, but that&#x27;s a benefit that I find marginal at best (how often do I really need to interact with physical things in my home when I&#x27;m not even there). The second benefit is much more valuable, but again it is likely to be marginal, because chances are your major devices are ones where you don&#x27;t actually need to change the settings (or replace parts, etc) very often, so it&#x27;s a convenience maybe 2 or 3 times a year, not a revolution in the way we interact with our homes and devices.", "parent": 8039913.0, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": null, "id": 8042082, "ranking": null, "date": 1405520074000, "year": 2014}, {"by": "TomStrickland", "score": 1.0, "time": 1405527625, "timestamp": 1405527625000, "title": "Worldwide Internet of Things Market to Exceed $7 Trillion by 2020\u2028\u2028", "type": "story", "url": "http://www.pubnub.com/blog/worldwide-internet-of-things-market-exceed-7-trillion/", "text": "", "parent": null, "deleted": null, "dead": true, "descendants": null, "id": 8042846, "ranking": null, "date": 1405527625000, "year": 2014}, {"by": "uxm", "score": 1.0, "time": 1405621298, "timestamp": 1405621298000, "title": "Internet of Things is fertile ground for UX innovation", "type": "story", "url": "http://uxmag.com/articles/disruptive-iot-innovation?utm_source=YC&utm_medium=ArticleShare&utm_tone=sf", "text": "", "parent": null, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": 0.0, "id": 8049221, "ranking": null, "date": 1405621298000, "year": 2014}, {"by": "jamesbritt", "score": 3.0, "time": 1405873213, "timestamp": 1405873213000, "title": "Why the Internet of Things Narrative Has to Change", "type": "story", "url": "http://thenextweb.com/dd/2014/07/19/internet-things-narrative-change/", "text": "", "parent": null, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": 0.0, "id": 8060706, "ranking": null, "date": 1405873213000, "year": 2014}, {"by": "herf", "score": null, "time": 1405879716, "timestamp": 1405879716000, "title": "", "type": "comment", "url": "", "text": "There is an additional need to make an automatic DMZ for &quot;internet of things&quot; devices (isolated like they&#x27;re in a guest network, or even firewalled entirely), while still cleverly routing in packets from mobile devices.", "parent": 8060784.0, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": null, "id": 8061032, "ranking": null, "date": 1405879716000, "year": 2014}, {"by": "wmf", "score": null, "time": 1405880832, "timestamp": 1405880832000, "title": "", "type": "comment", "url": "", "text": "Why is IOT special?", "parent": 8061032.0, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": null, "id": 8061087, "ranking": null, "date": 1405880832000, "year": 2014}, {"by": "VLM", "score": null, "time": 1405963344, "timestamp": 1405963344000, "title": "", "type": "comment", "url": "", "text": "Unfortunately, this is the high end of security for the future &quot;internet of things&quot;.

One of the things I predict will happen is that at some point a big push will be made to prevent people from randomly disposing of their old phones, instead either rewarding them monetarily or requiring their disposal in an &#x27;approved&#x27; way. At the recent visit to the equipment liquidator I sometimes buy from I saw a pallet with a box full of phones. All kinds from Nokia candybar phones to blackberries to off brand android phones. There had to be 2500 to 3000 phones in the box. I doubt they sold for more than breakage (0.03&#x2F;lb). But a motivated individual could &#x27;fix&#x27; that like this guy did. Buy them attach a solar power + battery source and cheap sim cards and doing nothing more than the phone was designed to do (record sound or take a picture, send an MMS message) Lots of interesting intelligence over a wide area could be acquired.

I could imagine this easily escalating into use of cryptography, which might then result in firmware hacking, countered by even stronger cryptography (e.g. signed firmware updates), leading to hardware hacking, stronger antitamper hardware, etc.", "parent": 8241089.0, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": null, "id": 8241562, "ranking": null, "date": 1409299594000, "year": 2014}, {"by": "shostack", "score": null, "time": 1409555045, "timestamp": 1409555045000, "title": "", "type": "comment", "url": "", "text": "Man do I wish I had something like this to play when I was in high school.<p>That quote at the beginning of the video is fascinating to me too.

This is an interesting dichotomy because it means picking things that may be hard but boring, or fun depending on how you look at them.<p>I am not affiliated with any of these companies. I just think some of them are well-placed in the market.<p>-Devops (mostly containers and virtualization software, but also fast&#x2F;easy build software, customizable configs that adapt better and searchable&#x2F;informative apis)<p>-Devops massive ssl&#x2F;managing keys&#x2F;passwords deployment software (there are a few automated tools that may help with this but there is in general not too many companies currently handling it)<p>-Devops massive worker model software or software that helps automation in newer&#x2F;interesting ways like stackengine (<a href=\"http://stackengine.com/blog/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackengine.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;</a>) just got $1 million in funding and provides a way to convert vagrant images to docker images and back again in a fast fashion<p>-Devops with companies that provide continuous integration at scale or preconfigured devops things that require too much learning to integrate etc, or alternatively lease integration tools. Also managed data worflow between many integrative models. <a href=\"https://jidoteki.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jidoteki.com&#x2F;</a><p>-Saas, PaaS, etc software as a service especially in devops looks to be going in several directions or so: 1)safe php applications using sandstorm sandbox and type-safe php llvm type stuff (integrating some of parse: <a href=\"https://parse.com/docs/php_guide\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;parse.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;php_guide</a> which makes traveling from one php application to another seamless, and Hoa which makes dsls more manageable <a href=\"http://hoa-project.net/En/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;hoa-project.net&#x2F;En&#x2F;</a> ) 2)devops delivered through docker + automated binary releases 3)devops in nodejs that controls docker and other things or just low latency&#x2F;fast productive js (dart could be a good useful bet) 4)determinable execution type programming mostly ocaml and haskell which are considered 90% correct and safer languages 5)clojure immutable data that can be shared between large amounts of web online applications<p>-safe low latency&#x2F;low requirement distributed services<p>-large data crunching (think distributed versus not distributed, purpose of what it is doing, competition)<p>-the coming large amount of &quot;internet of things&quot; in the next few years will be tons of small robots because of finally cheap enough robotics that they will be buyable + good software markets from many different companies working together The internet of things opens a new dimension for SaaS products that interact seamlessly this is an idealistic idea for how to structure something like that as many multiple agents: <a href=\"http://eve.almende.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;eve.almende.com&#x2F;</a>\nAlso training an AI in a massive simulation with cloud&#x2F;distributed tech with machine learning algorithms for real usage is a definite possibility<p>-privacy software (anonymous logins like facebook did, garbled circuits and homomorphic encryption, encrypted multiparty applications like auctions for bidding etc and cloud computing)<p>-artificial intelligence (not just &quot;deep learning&quot; on it&#x27;s own like convnets which are doing good performance wise but lack overall structural use, but intelligent software that can solve problems using many other algorithmic components like bloom filters, markov chains, dynamic time warping etc that focuses on specific problem solving interactive on-work jobs, data cleaning, vision, speech recognition and NLP)As a side-note if someone was able to improve data cleaning they can reduce a lot of errors by a large % and is under-utilized at the moment. Although it is problematic that most active learning algorithms ask for a lot more quesitons: <a href=\"https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/publication/scaling-up-crowd-sourcing-to-very-large-datasets-a-case-for-active-learning/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;amplab.cs.berkeley.edu&#x2F;publication&#x2F;scaling-up-crowd-...</a> . Crowd answering has been a better use for data cleaning.)<p>-Specifically Artificial Intelligence in vision through point cloud library needs to be more useful. Vision will need to be a very automated and big process and is not talked about as much on how hard it is to determine vision constraints like object detection and avoiding using edge detection etc. Simply learning to move is not the only problem associated with AI since vision is hard: <a href=\"http://pointclouds.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pointclouds.org&#x2F;</a><p>-Specifically Artifical Intelligence using networking to off-load some of the heavy load in computing lots of difficult&#x2F;complicated tasks by automating large chunks of activity as computer signals this is known as macroprogramming: <a href=\"http://fiji.eecs.harvard.edu/Macroprogramming\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;fiji.eecs.harvard.edu&#x2F;Macroprogramming</a> )<p>-3D Printing (I think metal 3d printing or harder material like construction from cement is more successful than regular plastic 3d printing as it can lead to more things getting done. 3d printing could be improved wholesale from some re-imaging by making it from adaptable molds rather than a dripple of material that moves (different concept than most 3d printing and may provide different results). Cheaper materials that are durable integration into actual electronics or support for holding computer chips in the printed models)<p>-Better safer faster payment gateways<p>-Anything security that helps solve the massive cybercrime problem that still plagues every major company (using AI for reviewing security control policies, account policies, and more CYBR IPO does this)<p>-Also related in security Intrusion detection systems have risen over 30% in sales lately, and despite defense being a lot better upgraded recently there are still many evident attack vectors. A key factor in this is companies by policy are almost always forced to use older technology, people enjoy renting out windows computers and windows computers have better virtualization server balancing support because they are the most tested)<p>-data content management systems that make data more available and easily constructable&#x2F;displayable<p>-I like how you mentioned &quot;wearables&quot; as a seperate category. There are many things that could be wearables that are not watches most likely that people could use. A swiss army knife type thing (something that can solve many problems) that is electronic yet still carryable on a normal day basis or maybe job specific could take off.<p>-Using constraint provers to reason around problems in the human domain (math etc) or in computer optimization&#x2F;security<p>-Generated business reports using machine learning + formatting (abuse free services like ipython, ihaskell, etc for output)<p>-Tools that keep people productive (extremely wide category there is lots of old software in it, but mostly is just old, any new way with better UI and more useful features can surpass tons of old software.)<p>-A &quot;sensor world.&quot; Sensors cost near to nothing now (just a few cents under a dollar) and they can be placed basically everywhere. There needs to be a better hive-mind like use for them. Also pretty soon phone apps or simple vision type apps could be able to quickly identify objects around them using web-apps and machine learning that could provide specs or information on them as well as interact with them.<p>-Just simply &quot;tech of tommorrow.&quot; Things that &quot;can scale&quot; massively or improve performance tech wise with speciality in that domain, though this isn&#x27;t likely a first startup idea.<p>Note: I can list more if people want or I could expand with more specific examples of software or companies that do things in these fields etc. Feel free to reply.", "parent": 8397744.0, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": null, "id": 8399634, "ranking": null, "date": 1412231007000, "year": 2014}, {"by": "tdrnd", "score": 3.0, "time": 1412239571, "timestamp": 1412239571000, "title": "Key players in Internet of Things promote Thread protocol at Google campus", "type": "story", "url": "http://www.cnet.com/news/internet-of-things-promote-thread-protocol-at-google/", "text": "", "parent": null, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": 0.0, "id": 8399892, "ranking": null, "date": 1412239571000, "year": 2014}, {"by": "FUSAR_rs", "score": null, "time": 1412254912, "timestamp": 1412254912000, "title": "", "type": "comment", "url": "", "text": "New York, NY<p>FUSAR Technologies - Wearable tech for the road and racetrack.

Traditional technical solutions to most problems completely break down for this use case. Some specific points:<p>- A lot of IoT data is passively collected and reconstructed external to a device you own for applications that run on the device. Decentralizing the applications does not decentralize access to the data in practice. This makes perfect engineering sense: it saves a lot of battery and bandwidth on the device to not have the device involved in phoning home even if it is effectively &quot;phoning home&quot;. (Few people grok how sophisticated this type of data reconstruction is.)<p>- IoT data coming off consumer devices is higher velocity and higher volume than anyone imagines unless you work with it. Billions of records per second continuously, petabytes per day, from single data sources. See above: the data your device effectively generates is not limited by the bandwidth of the device. Most applications of this data joins several of these data sources, often in real-time.<p>- The fundamental operation done on IoT data that makes it uniquely useful for consumer and other applications is the spatial join. If you think you are going to do that on a decentralized peer-to-peer network then you don&#x27;t understand spatial joins. Doubly so considering the aforementioned bandwidth requirements.<p>Having physical control of a device will allow some control of where data goes but the architectural requirements of IoT will greatly constrain the extent to which this is possible in practice.", "parent": 8442266.0, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": null, "id": 8443031, "ranking": null, "date": 1413052791000, "year": 2014}, {"by": "sigmar", "score": null, "time": 1413053165, "timestamp": 1413053165000, "title": "", "type": "comment", "url": "", "text": "Those are definitely some interesting insights and I would imagine that those three categories apply to any luxury item customer.

As Edison wrote, &quot;Genius is 1% inspiration and 99% perspiration.&quot;<p>Here are a few ideas I don&#x27;t have time to pursue.<p>1. Make extruder-type 3D printing work better by heating the material just laid down, just ahead of the weld point. Use hot air or a small, maybe 5W laser diode.  Use 3 heat points 120 degrees apart so you can heat ahead of the direction of travel. Modulate the laser with pulse-width modulation, then read the temperature during the off period with two photodiodes with different IR filters. Go closed-loop on the temperature.<p>2. Initial application for automatic driving - airport auto rental.  Book rental in advance. When customer&#x27;s phone shows up at destination airport, dispatch car to terminal, timed to show up just after luggage pickup.  Use phone to direct customer to car.  On return, customer drops off car at terminal, and it head back to rental lot on its own. Self-driving is limited to low speed in known areas.  Expand system by adding parking garages at likely car rental destinations, such as convention centers.<p>3. Conference room automation.  Video projector should have camera, find screen, put up test pattern, focus, correct for parallax.  Room lights should sense projector&#x2F;external lighting situation.  Microphone system should automatically track speaker from a distance (this exists, using a hemisphere with a large number of microphones and a lot of CPU power) without any effort by speaker.  Video feed of talks and classroom should have people tracking and automatically generate a useful video feed.  The whole thing should Just Work. Internet of Things crowd, get busy.<p>4. Integer overflow, both signed and unsigned, should trap in CPUs.  If you want modular arithmetic modulo the word size, you should write &quot;x+= (x % 65536)&quot;, and the compiler should understand that as an idiom, generating an cheap unchecked unsigned add.<p>5. Set import duties to recover about half the wage difference between the exporting and importing countries.  This escapes the &quot;race to the bottom&quot; problem.\nHalf, so as not to have too much protectionism.  Politically difficult, but the current ratio for the minimum wage in Shentzen to the US is 5.6. China is getting close to where this is feasible.<p>Idea generation is easy.

To me, that attitude seems half like a cynical cop-out and half cyberpunk wish-fulfillment. No infrastructure which requires as much complexity and cost and effort as that does, is immune to political, economic or societal forces.<p>Already, you can begin to see pushback from other (many themselves) government and some companies like Apple, who both may be genuinely bothered by government intrusion and see &quot;privacy&quot; as a near-long-term necessity for selling products domestically but more importantly globally. It&#x27;s true that Facebook is creepy, but it&#x27;s also true that people have known that Facebook is creepy for years now and young people are leaving in droves.<p>Of course, <i>nearly</i> ubiquitous surveillance would be much more likely. Probably not all of our worst nightmares, but more than enough.<p>I personally believe (I even wrote a terrible paper about it that will never see the light of day) that the biggest and most pervasive threat to freedom in regards to privacy will lie in the intersection of (not strong but good enough) AI, social media, and the internet of things. Essentially, we&#x27;re coming to a point at which our devices will be designed to interact with us emotionally, as well as socially, and as a result people will be trained to form deep emotional relationships with products as well as people. Imagine having a deep intellectual conversation with someone online, only that someone is a refrigerator, or a car. Imagine most of the friends you&#x27;ve grown up with are products, because most of your interaction is online.<p>Maybe it happens, maybe it doesn&#x27;t, but almost certainly it won&#x27;t happen the way we currently predict. The future right after the moon landings isn&#x27;t the one anyone would have predicted. We were supposed to be drinking Coca-Colas on Mars by now.<p>Although <i>if</i> it did happen, then i&#x27;m still not entirely certain the &#x27;humane-but-totalistic&#x27; model necessarily works. In theory, yes, but in practice, if everyone knew everything about everyone else, this wouldn&#x27;t necessarily balance power between the weak and the strong (and imbalance which exists in the real work, but not Star Trek) but would enable the strong to more easily dominate the weak. Because such systems can&#x27;t be perfect, there must always be ways to exploit information asymmetry. Governments, corporations and criminals will always be more able to rig the system than will the common person.<p>I like Star Trek, but because it presents a Utopian ideal, i&#x27;m skeptical of using it as a springboard for describing actual potential future societies, because humans just don&#x27;t work that way.

This also applies to incubators, startups you might join, employees you might recruit, etc.<p>(4) Trendy not-invented-last-week syndrome abounds on the technology side: <a href=\"http://www.jwz.org/blog/2003/02/the-cadt-model/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jwz.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2003&#x2F;02&#x2F;the-cadt-model&#x2F;</a><p>(5) Given the quantities of money involved, I&#x27;d expect investors to be more rational than they really are. &quot;Raise on no numbers or good numbers&quot; -- that doesn&#x27;t exactly strike me as rational. No numbers is better than some growth? That&#x27;s not by any means the worst example either. I once had an investor type tell me with a straight face that he looks for founders with a &quot;prominent jaw line, an alpha male look.&quot;<p>(6) Founding or building something is lonely, thankless, isolating, and a lot longer of a death march than you probably realize... unless of course you are &quot;juiced&quot; in which case you can walk into a VC firm and walk out with millions for a product that doesn&#x27;t exist. Then you can hire people to build it while you wheel and deal and pimp your ego. The existence of this kind of &quot;juice&quot; can be enormously discouraging to mere mortals. It&#x27;s enough to make you wonder if this game isn&#x27;t as rigged as Wall Street. (I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s <i>quite</i> as rigged as Wall Street, but there&#x27;s definitely a privilege network.)<p>(7) With all the talk of innovation you hear from people like Peter Thiel, the reality is that the most profitable stuff is usually some kind of equity play on the rapid growth of some trendy thing that isn&#x27;t technically that interesting. Examples include Facebook, Snapchat, etc. If you want to extend the human life span, develop AI, or otherwise advance the human condition, sign up for a vow of poverty. The only hack around this seems to be to do something a bit more &quot;boring&quot; to make enough money to then do something more visionary. The poster boy for this is Elon Musk. There are also exceptions -- things that can be both profitable and interesting -- but those also tend to be the hardest death marches of all. While you&#x27;re struggling to create real value, someone else is making millions flipping some kind of social media app of the week.<p>(8) Mobile is the future this week. Last week it was the web. Next week it&#x27;ll be the Internet of Things and nobody will ever fund another mobile startup. Desktop is dead even though everyone builds absolutely everything on a desktop. See #4.<p>(9) Don&#x27;t let anyone fool you -- tech is sexist as hell and geek culture is misogynistic with a faint whiff of creepy pedophilia and other chthonic horrors. If you don&#x27;t have a penis, be prepared for subtile hazing and grunt work and possibly drool on your seat cushion. Racism exists too, but it&#x27;s less stark and omnipresent than the misogyny.<p>(10) Age-ism is big too, and it contributes a lot to #8 and #4. A big reason for this is that all the incubator and accelerator programs are geared toward unmarried childless recent college grads who can move on a whim, room with six other people, and special enzymes that can derive a full spectrum of nutrients from ramen and energy drinks.<p>I could keep going.<p>Yet I keep coming back for more.

There are three issues that must be dealt with when trying to make it easy for developers to create decentralised systems that can withstand the test of time.  There are a number of (open-source) things I&#x27;m working on that could help so I&#x27;ll describe in terms of the problems they&#x27;re solving.<p>First is the issue of how one creates, deploys and manages the whole lifetime of an application. The current stacks are not up to the task given the huge complexity, footprints and vulnerabilities we see. All the tools we currently see are stopgaps that attempt to paper over the cracks.  This will become even more important (and visible) as the Internet of things becomes a reality.  IMHO this is where unikernels such as Mirage OS can be very impactful [1].<p>Second is the issue of how data is synced and pushed around. As indicated in the article, the blockchain is not appropriate for this. Bit-torrent may provide some of the answer but not all of it. We needs systems that can track provenance that can be composed in the way most appropriate for a given application. The Irmin datastore, which is based on the principles of Git, is one approach to this [2].<p>Third is the dual problem of identity and how to form secure end-to-end connections over the modern Internet (with all the middleboxes and NATs we now have). This is clearly something all the central providers want to control by being your One True Identity - but as we already know from the pseudonym problems, humans are not that simple.  A nascent project called Signpost aims to tackle this [3].<p>One of the use-cases I&#x27;m working towards is to make it trivially simple for users to run their own core infrastructure of Mail, Contacts and Calendars [4]. Building things on top of this infrastructure then becomes more compelling and it&#x27;s just as applicable to business as it is to individuals.<p>Even though I&#x27;ve listed the tools that <i>I</i> think will alleviate the issues, the fact remains that all these problems needs to resolved somehow - otherwise we&#x27;ll be back to centralised systems regardless.  In addition, I&#x27;ve only mentioned the <i>technical</i> challenges \u2014 the business model challenges are another thing entirely.<p>[1] <a href=\"http://openmirage.org/wiki/overview-of-mirage\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;openmirage.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;overview-of-mirage</a><p>[2] <a href=\"http://openmirage.org/blog/introducing-irmin\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;openmirage.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;introducing-irmin</a><p>[3] <a href=\"http://nymote.org/docs/2013-foci-signposts.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;nymote.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;2013-foci-signposts.pdf</a><p>[4] <a href=\"http://nymote.org/blog/2013/introducing-nymote/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;nymote.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2013&#x2F;introducing-nymote&#x2F;</a>", "parent": 8866849.0, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": null, "id": 8867415, "ranking": null, "date": 1420913855000, "year": 2015}, {"by": "DyslexicAtheist", "score": 1.0, "time": 1420938849, "timestamp": 1420938849000, "title": "Brewie: the Internet of things comes to beer brewing", "type": "story", "url": "http://siliconangle.com/blog/2015/01/01/brewie-the-internet-of-things-comes-to-beer-brewing/", "text": "", "parent": null, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": 0.0, "id": 8868643, "ranking": null, "date": 1420938849000, "year": 2015}, {"by": "niutech", "score": null, "time": 1420981876, "timestamp": 1420981876000, "title": "", "type": "comment", "url": "", "text": "My PrIoT Manifesto (<a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8820432\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=8820432</a>) is just about decentralization of Internet of Things.

To understand it, read &quot;PJM 101&quot;[4])<p>For a clear distinction between operational and situation rooms, here&#x27;s NYC&#x27;s emergency call center, which answers 911.[5] It&#x27;s a big call center room of cubicles. Each station has three screens and a phone system, but the few big screens around are just showing overall statistics.   NYC also has their COMPSTAT room.[6]  It&#x27;s just a conference room with a big screen.  There are no controls at the seats.<p>The first real control centers were railroad signal towers. There&#x27;s a whole history of those, and it&#x27;s worth understanding how they managed safety.  Early ones had big levers, and early on, those were interlocked.  The Bluebell Railway, a heritage railway in England, is big enough to need a full signal system, and it&#x27;s all antique equipment. Watch this video.[7]  About 5 minutes in, you can see someone operating the huge levers to set signals and switches in a signal tower. At 5:18, they pull a big lever, and it moves about an inch and won&#x27;t move further. They&#x27;ve tried to throw a track switch, and the mechanical interlocking won&#x27;t let them throw that switch until the track is clear and the related signals have been set to stop. When you design &quot;Internet of things&quot; systems, try to do as well as that 1880s technology.<p>Military and NASA control rooms usually have a feature rarely seen elsewhere - anyone can view, read-only, anyone else&#x27;s screen. In the original NASA and NORAD control centers, which used the same Philco hardware, all the screens were analog TVs, and they had a channel selector, so you could view any console&#x27;s main feed. This is done so that when important stuff is happening on one screen, others can look at it without crowding around the person controlling that screen. Once you have that feature, the need for multiple big screens decreases. A military tactical operations center today is often one modest size big screen and a bunch of laptops.<p>[1] <a href=\"http://www.archdaily.com/29186/moesk-control-center-arch-group-abtb/9_variant-3d/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.archdaily.com&#x2F;29186&#x2F;moesk-control-center-arch-gro...</a>\n[2] <a href=\"http://www.elliottlewis.com/casestudy-pjm.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.elliottlewis.com&#x2F;casestudy-pjm.html</a>\n[3] <a href=\"https://edata.pjm.com/eData/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;edata.pjm.com&#x2F;eData&#x2F;index.html</a>\n[4] <a href=\"http://pjm.com/Globals/Training/Courses/ol-pjm-101.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pjm.com&#x2F;Globals&#x2F;Training&#x2F;Courses&#x2F;ol-pjm-101.aspx</a>\n[5] <a href=\"http://www.nyc.gov/html/nypd/images/pr/pr_2012_01_05_psac_911_call_takers.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nyc.gov&#x2F;html&#x2F;nypd&#x2F;images&#x2F;pr&#x2F;pr_2012_01_05_psac_91...</a>\n[6] <a href=\"http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2014/09/23/nypd-dedicates-compstat-room-to-creator-jack-maple/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;newyork.cbslocal.com&#x2F;2014&#x2F;09&#x2F;23&#x2F;nypd-dedicates-compst...</a>\n[7] <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijWNtrvcEVA\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=ijWNtrvcEVA</a>", "parent": 9182905.0, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": null, "id": 9185670, "ranking": null, "date": 1426097795000, "year": 2015}, {"by": "rgovind", "score": 2.0, "time": 1426190917, "timestamp": 1426190917000, "title": "Amazon Quietly Acquires 2lemetry Tto Build Out Its Internet of Things Strategy", "type": "story", "url": "http://techcrunch.com/2015/03/12/amazon-has-quietly-acquired-2lemetry-to-build-out-its-internet-of-things-strategy/", "text": "", "parent": null, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": 0.0, "id": 9193480, "ranking": null, "date": 1426190917000, "year": 2015}, {"by": "PebblesHD", "score": null, "time": 1426312032, "timestamp": 1426312032000, "title": "", "type": "comment", "url": "", "text": "At this point in the evolution in technology, I find that Stallman is increasingly irrelevant when his commentary is basically stating every basic point of the site and then saying its bad.

Frankly, Evernote has been at it for 7 years and spent $225M on the problem, and they have done a pretty damn great job at it.<p>I&#x27;ve asked myself WHY do I want to host my own data. My innermost thoughts are hard to imagine being broadcast to the NSA, Chinese government, and any ambitious cracker... but what I write about I will eventually publish anyhow. And the projects I am working on will eventually be free software anyhow. AND even with my own infrastructure I know that the NSA&#x2F;Chinese&#x2F;Crackers could find a way in.<p>I gave up on giving up on the cloud. From one perspective, I think that security through obscurity (with 7 Billion folks, why does my stuff matter THAT much?) is a thing. Another thing is that if my work were discovered, what would happen? Controversy? Notoriety? As a marketer I crave those things.<p>I have some very patentable, valuable work sitting in Evernote, Google Drive, iCloud, OneDrive, various local and hosted Owncloud&#x2F;NeverNote&#x2F;Laverna&#x2F;LibreOffice files.

I think that CoreOS&#x2F;Ubuntu Core could be the foundation for personal grid computing, every app can be a container with on demand scaling and failover, and that data transport can be equally at home on a sneakernet, the internet of today, or the mesh network of tomorrow. I believe that data is soveign, sharing of that data should always be FINITE, all user interfaces should be stateless, and hardware should allow for users to compose their own interfaces. In this future, VR and IOT are instantly integrated, everybody owns their own data, and short of physical access data isn&#x27;t shared ever ever ever unless with finite permission.<p>I&#x27;m using Evernote for now because it is fast and lets me work on my work.

In other words you get something up and running quickly, then spend a massive amount of time manually (there is no proper debug environment) debugging edge cases and trying to optimize it for real world cases. The time savings aren&#x27;t really there for many projects, as you end up spending more time than if you had used something like C++.<p>The last version of Mathematica (v10) was released over a year ago without an update to the Eclipse plugin, making an already pretty archaic development experience impossible.<p>The front end debugger isn&#x27;t a &#x27;fair&#x27; debugger.

More people using it, more companies getting involved etc, can be more important.<p>When we look at price historically we can find strange things like the price being a fraction of a dollar (some 70 cents or so) in April in 2011. Only a few months later, in June 2011, the price was $30. And then it collapsed that very same year and the price dropped to $2, a few times more than it was earlier, but far from the peak.<p>It&#x27;d have been pretty myopic to then conclude that bitcoin was past its peak, even though in the short term it was, having lost more than 90% of its value at peak. It&#x27;d also have been wrong to say it missed its chance at mainstream success.<p>Today the price is an order of magnitude larger, and users, usage and involvement with mainstream (large) companies has grown even more.<p>So again, it&#x27;s quite possible, but I think too soon to tell.<p>As for the lack of interest from the general public... I think bitcoin at its core is a utility, like you could say the internet is. The internet is extremely uninteresting to people, very few get it, nobody is excited about it. But the web is huge, as is emailing and skype and netflix. That&#x27;s completely different from the Internet though, the boring platform&#x2F;utility&#x2F;infrastructure that supports it. I can&#x27;t blame someone not being interested in bitcoin. But internet of things having digital wallets and doing payments, contracts, deeds etc on the bitcoin ledger, where all the consumer sees is that it &#x27;just works&#x27;, that&#x27;s interesting. It&#x27;s up to companies then to build ontop of bitcoin, and there is tons of interest from companies, both startups and traditional (tech) companies. Which means it&#x27;s not very surprising to see companies and VCs get excited, but the general public not, in the same way that few got excited about the Internet, but Internet entrepreneurs did, who built companies like Amazon or Skype that people did get excited about. The fact that bitcoin couldn&#x27;t start out like that and had to grow based on a small amount of fanatics looking to avoid the dollar&#x2F;euro&#x2F;etc and live on a new currency is probably a great source of distraction from the larger point of bitcoin as a platform, as it reduces bitcoin to being a currency used to shop online and not many feel like doing that, making it look as there is no interest from the general public and nobody will ever use it etc.", "parent": 9575609.0, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": null, "id": 9575796, "ranking": null, "date": 1432124435000, "year": 2015}, {"by": "mtuncer", "score": 1.0, "time": 1432129883, "timestamp": 1432129883000, "title": "The Security, Privacy and Legal Implications of the Internet of Things (\u201cIoT\u201d)", "type": "story", "url": "http://www.dataprotectionreport.com/2015/05/the-security-privacy-legal-implications-of-the-internet-of-things-iot-part-one-the-context-and-use-of-iot/", "text": "", "parent": null, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": 0.0, "id": 9576268, "ranking": null, "date": 1432129883000, "year": 2015}, {"by": "jasonlaramburu", "score": 1.0, "time": 1432149832, "timestamp": 1432149832000, "title": "The 5 Fastest Growing Internet of Things Startups", "type": "story", "url": "http://tech.co/5-fastest-growing-internet-things-startups-2015-05", "text": "", "parent": null, "deleted": null, "dead": true, "descendants": null, "id": 9578585, "ranking": null, "date": 1432149832000, "year": 2015}, {"by": "ingve", "score": 26.0, "time": 1432226529, "timestamp": 1432226529000, "title": "Google Developing \u201cBrillo\u201d Internet of Things OS Based on Android", "type": "story", "url": "http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2015/05/google-developing-brillo-internet-of-things-os-based-on-android/", "text": "", "parent": null, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": 22.0, "id": 9583822, "ranking": null, "date": 1432226529000, "year": 2015}, {"by": "vaibhavnoob", "score": 2.0, "time": 1432227134, "timestamp": 1432227134000, "title": "Google will launch its software for Internet of Things", "type": "story", "url": "http://www.thegeekbyte.com/4735/google-will-launch-its-software-for-internet-of-things/", "text": "", "parent": null, "deleted": null, "dead": true, "descendants": null, "id": 9583883, "ranking": null, "date": 1432227134000, "year": 2015}, {"by": "adidash", "score": 2.0, "time": 1432227512, "timestamp": 1432227512000, "title": "Google Developing \u2018Brillo\u2019 Software for Internet of Things", "type": "story", "url": "https://www.theinformation.com/Google-Developing-Brillo-Software-for-Internet-of-Things", "text": "", "parent": null, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": 1.0, "id": 9583923, "ranking": null, "date": 1432227512000, "year": 2015}, {"by": "bikeshack", "score": 2.0, "time": 1432233470, "timestamp": 1432233470000, "title": "Google to Introduce New Internet of Things Software at IO to Take Over Your Home", "type": "story", "url": "http://www.droid-life.com/2015/05/21/report-google-to-introduce-new-internet-of-things-software-at-io-to-take-over-your-home/", "text": "", "parent": null, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": 0.0, "id": 9584570, "ranking": null, "date": 1432233470000, "year": 2015}, {"by": "jonbaer", "score": 2.0, "time": 1432270708, "timestamp": 1432270708000, "title": "Google Reportedly Developing 'Brillo,' an OS for the Internet of Things", "type": "story", "url": "http://www.cnet.com/news/google-reportedly-developing-brillo-an-os-for-the-internet-of-things/", "text": "", "parent": null, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": 0.0, "id": 9586608, "ranking": null, "date": 1432270708000, "year": 2015}, {"by": "BigDataStartups", "score": 1.0, "time": 1432301091, "timestamp": 1432301091000, "title": "The Internet of Things, Big Data and Preventative Predictions", "type": "story", "url": "https://datafloq.com/read/IoT-big-data-preventative-predictions/1123", "text": "", "parent": null, "deleted": null, "dead": true, "descendants": null, "id": 9588078, "ranking": null, "date": 1432301091000, "year": 2015}, {"by": "minthd", "score": null, "time": 1432309777, "timestamp": 1432309777000, "title": "", "type": "comment", "url": "", "text": "&gt;&gt; Android&#x27;s installable service components could make updatable, highly flexible IoT nodes realistic.<p>In concrete terms , what are the benefits of those to IOT nodes ?

People who are not advanced computer users have never heard of &quot;Free Software,&quot; the FSF, GNU, or Richard Stallman. On the other hand, &quot;open source&quot; software has some name recognition among folks like, say, my mother. Young developers (such as myself), have discovered Free Software <i>through</i> an original interest in &quot;open source.&quot;<p>With that in mind, I think it would make sense to just use the terminology people are comfortable with, and continue making the <i>same distinction</i> by promoting &quot;ethical open source&quot; or &quot;permissive open source&quot; or something like that. If the worry really is that the language around open source is everywhere scrubbed of the original free software ethos (I&#x27;m not too sure about that), a sensible move would be counter that by staking out a corner of &quot;open source&quot; and using it to promote ethical software. Chastising people for the way they speak just sows hostility among potential friends.<p>Stallman always talks about the importance of language, and Orwell&#x27;s shadow is clearly visible over these rants. But &quot;open source&quot; isn&#x27;t euphamistic doublespeak - it&#x27;s not inherently more difficult to think about ethical software when you call it open source instead of free. From an outside perspective, the only difference is that &quot;free software&quot; has a confusing double meaning that &quot;open source&quot; doesn&#x27;t. Free software (or whatever) already is fighting a battle for relevance. Why choose an uphill battle?<p>FOOTNOTE: The fact that Stallman&#x27;s pet terminology is <i>always</i> linked to his personal organizations also damages his credibility. It makes it easy to dismiss him as sour grapes. I personally think he deserves recognition, but then again, there&#x27;s no shortage of software named after GNU...", "parent": 9711346.0, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": null, "id": 9716661, "ranking": null, "date": 1434323615000, "year": 2015}, {"by": "jesusmrv", "score": 2.0, "time": 1434460128, "timestamp": 1434460128000, "title": "Building an IOT Platform: Centralized vs. Decentralized Models", "type": "story", "url": "https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/building-iot-platform-centralized-vs-decentralized-models-rodriguez", "text": "", "parent": null, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": 1.0, "id": 9725432, "ranking": null, "date": 1434460128000, "year": 2015}, {"by": "rossiben", "score": 1.0, "time": 1434534673, "timestamp": 1434534673000, "title": "Developers say 80% Internet of Things apps of will make money by 2018", "type": "story", "url": "http://www.information-age.com/technology/applications-and-development/123459672/two-thirds-internet-things-apps-make-money-research", "text": "", "parent": null, "deleted": null, "dead": true, "descendants": null, "id": 9730818, "ranking": null, "date": 1434534673000, "year": 2015}, {"by": "jesusmrv", "score": 1.0, "time": 1434546335, "timestamp": 1434546335000, "title": "Building an IOT Platform: Centralized vs. Decentralized Models", "type": "story", "url": "http://jrodthoughts.com/2015/06/17/building-an-iot-platform-centralized-vs-decentralized-models/", "text": "", "parent": null, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": 0.0, "id": 9731503, "ranking": null, "date": 1434546335000, "year": 2015}, {"by": "CyberVision", "score": 1.0, "time": 1434550103, "timestamp": 1434550103000, "title": "Accessing IoT Data with Couchbase Server, Couchbase Mobile and Kaa", "type": "story", "url": "", "text": "Andrew Kokhanovskyi, the CTO of CyberVision, gave a speaking session at Couchbase Connect 2015 on the subject of \u201cAccessing IoT Data with Couchbase Server, Couchbase Mobile and Kaa\u201d.

Just getting the right tests quoted for 80% of products out there can fit into a page or two of drop-downs and check boxes.  Most things fit into some reasonable categories, but maybe another service this broker could provide would be that if you select something that could open a can of worms (like if you are making a radio transmitter in a non-ISM band) that it presents a big yellow warning with tons of info on the traps you&#x27;re about to fall into.<p>Obviously the broker I describe can&#x27;t know everything about your product and market segment and customers and said laws that would apply, but 80% of the time, there&#x27;s nothing unique to a product from a regulatory point of view, someone already has a product which falls under very similar guidelines.

Right now, we have 7-inch tablets and 7-inch phones. It&#x27;s pretty easy to see that these are essentially the same thing. Windows 10 brings a unified operating system which adapts to form factors, but the centerpiece is Cortana. Many people are looking to the future of computing as cloud-based personal assistants which connect to the Internet of Things, and Microsoft is currently ahead of everyone in this area, with Google, Apple, and Amazon close behnd. The form factor of the device a person uses becomes less important as interconnected, data-driven services become the platform.<p>People keep misinterpreting the Nokia layoffs as giving up on phones. What actually happened was that the phone department was rolled into the Windows department. Windows Phone is dead, but Windows Mobile has replaced it as a transition into just Windows, the platform-agnostic, cloud-based, Cortana-driven operating system. The future Internet will not be phone-based. Phones will be a convenient form-factor for the near future, but they are just nodes in the cloud.<p>There&#x27;s plenty of time for everyone to catch up to Microsoft, but I think everyone should be paying attention to what they&#x27;re doing. Remember when the iPod was the most important thing that Apple had? Microsoft is betting that its future as a company is not dependent on building a better Zune.

I&#x27;ve read Richard Stallman&#x27;s blog for the last 15 years, and he has had a lot of good thoughts about it. I think everyone should have access to privacy, but I don&#x27;t think everything should be private.<p>Games are a good example. Nobody would expect a baseball player to object to tracking statistics. That&#x27;s a big part of what makes the game. Online gaming is the same way. Tracking achievements adds to the fun for a lot of people.<p>But there are also larger social issues where tracking can be beneficial. We live in a world with a lot of diversity and an increasing amount of information. People get overwhelmed and tend to revert to tribal thinking, attacking anything that doesn&#x27;t fit their group&#x27;s perspective. I don&#x27;t know if people on their own could ever get over this type of behavior in a world that&#x27;s impossible to keep up with without taking mental shortcuts and relying on summaries of what&#x27;s happening.<p>Personalized deep learning is an attempt to create a relatively neutral arbiter of all this information, distill it into something useful based not only on the user&#x27;s behavior but also the aggregate of everyone&#x27;s behavior. The algorithms don&#x27;t just learn from what you like but have the potential to uncover interests and information that you might never be able to access outside your bubble.<p>Cortana brings that kind of aggregate information gathering to your desktop. It&#x27;s an early example, and it needs lots and lots of data to learn, and the more diverse the data set it can analyze, the closer it can be to doing its job of feeding relevant information.<p>Windows 10 is also meant to be an Internet of Things OS. Lots of companies are working on connected devices that depend on syncing with your account. A common example for today is telling Cortana to remind you to pick up milk when you&#x27;re at the store. The reminder goes to your account, and when your phone detects you&#x27;re at the store, it reminds you to pick up milk.<p>Of course, there are people who are going to try to use this to sell you things, but that&#x27;s always been the case. The hope of people working on these things is that it can bring you actually relevant suggestions instead of just the products with the largest advertising budgets. Old advertising models were very centralized and only the largest ones could really win. Personalized advertising might be able to bring the smaller but more relevant products to your attention.<p>Personally, I don&#x27;t like advertising, and I&#x27;m not especially excited about this part of it, but that&#x27;s definitely the monetary angle for it. The part that does excite me is the possibility that we can start to break down some of the communication barriers between people, get people outside of their bubbles, and bring relevant information to people based on large trends instead of isolated social groups.<p>There&#x27;s plenty to be skeptical about here. Money tends to push things in directions that only benefit the ones with money. Microsoft and all the other IoT companies have a lot to prove before their products can be considered actually relevant for people. There&#x27;s a good chance most of them will be no better than the old way of doing things. But there&#x27;s a lot of potential there too.<p>Privacy should always be an option, but having a public online life can be good for people too.", "parent": 9977300.0, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": null, "id": 9978044, "ranking": null, "date": 1438289823000, "year": 2015}, {"by": "noveltysystems", "score": 2.0, "time": 1438290068, "timestamp": 1438290068000, "title": "Internet of Things \u2013 Map of the IoT Ecosystem", "type": "story", "url": "https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/internet-things-map-iot-ecosystem-chris-mccann", "text": "", "parent": null, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": 0.0, "id": 9978076, "ranking": null, "date": 1438290068000, "year": 2015}, {"by": "Raed667", "score": 2.0, "time": 1438344746, "timestamp": 1438344746000, "title": "Why the Internet of Things Sucks", "type": "story", "url": "http://raed.tn/blog/internet-of-things-sucks/", "text": "", "parent": null, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": 0.0, "id": 9981231, "ranking": null, "date": 1438344746000, "year": 2015}, {"by": "JacksonBond", "score": 2.0, "time": 1438440528, "timestamp": 1438440528000, "title": "Internet of ThingsFunky Connected PrayerWheel Project", "type": "story", "url": "https://www.dizmo.com/connecting-a-self-made-prayer-wheel-to-dizmo/", "text": "", "parent": null, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": 1.0, "id": 9987178, "ranking": null, "date": 1438440528000, "year": 2015}, {"by": "lollipop25", "score": null, "time": 1438481765, "timestamp": 1438481765000, "title": "", "type": "comment", "url": "", "text": "&gt; Should I jump into learning all the &quot;new framework&quot;-javascript, htmlX, &lt;insert any new framework&gt;, should I keep working on improve what I already do&#x2F;like?<p>You may learn other things, but stick to what you know and specialize.<p>- You know C#, probably you could learn game development with Unity as it also uses C#.

In addition, WebAssembly (imagine binary executable payloads over the web) is in the works - which means you can use any language (as long as it compiles to web assembly) to make stuff.<p>- If you go the electronics route, JS is also in the hardware and IoT (internet of things) business.

A Samsung executive was touting an Internet-enabled refrigerator, which was basically just a refrigerator with a tablet built into the door, with no special sensors, costing more than a refrigerator plus a tablet.  I asked him why they&#x27;d built the product, and got an honest answer. He said the market was three types of people:<p>- People who just had to have the latest thing - early adopters.\n- People who like to show off their houses to other people (the granite kitchen counter crowd)\n- People who just like to buy expensive stuff and will buy the most expensive thing.<p>I talked to a HVAC engineer there. The room we were in was an old industrial building in SF.  It had skylights with chains and toothed pulleys for opening them, openable windows, curtains for both, ceiling fans, both spotlights and light cans, a video projector and powered screen, and a standard HVAC system controlled by a standard thermostat.  Controlling and coordinating all that would be a good &quot;internet of things&quot; application.  He pointed out that companies which installed that sort of thing wanted it to work, and not generate service calls.  Engineering, installing and connecting all the motors and sensors to run that room properly would be a big job.  Motorizing the old skylights alone would need custom engineering.<p>That&#x27;s the problem. Internet of Things stuff that&#x27;s actually useful requires more than buying some plastic gadgets.

Fires just aren&#x27;t that big of a problem statistically and while a smoke alarm that can call the fire department is great in theory, in practice people are leery of false alarms when it could be incredibly expensive.  And the &#x27;works with nest&#x27; integrations are fascinating: its largly a bunch of companies that want to be associated with Nest and its percieved superiority from a brand&#x2F;acquisition&#x2F;something(?) perspective and then integrate these super low value add enhancements.

Best of all, you can get it for only $49 when you back the CUJO Indiegogo campaign.<p>The days of protecting your home with just an alarm system or Antivirus are over. If you have a TV, a smartphone, or even a baby monitor at home, then you are an easy target for cyber criminals. It takes 20 minutes before criminals attempt to hack your newly connected devices. More often than not, they succeed.<p>Why is it important to get extra Internet security for your home? Criminal hackers break into your home devices to steal your identity, watch your cameras, access your financial info, and worse. Kids and older adults are especially susceptible to falling victim for stalkers and impersonators. Your home is full of smart devices but Antivirus software is built to only protect your PC so it is ineffective in most cases. And firewalls are outdated the moment they ship.

Moving household controls like heating to a virtual interface would allow me to control everything from the same place, eg. my laptop (which I&#x27;m normally sat in front of anyway). It also allows meta-level controllers to be written, eg. using cron jobs, or defining a bunch of common settings like &quot;cold night&quot;, &quot;frugal&quot;, etc.<p>- Home automation. This makes control automatic, and can involve homeostatic properties, eg. thermostats keeping a constant temperature; reactive systems like motion sensors switching on lights; to constraint&#x2F;rule-based scheduling of tasks and appliances (eg. the washing must be done by Friday, but use the cheapest electricity; ensure heating and cooling are never on at the same time; etc.)<p>- Putting it all online. I think this is the biggest problem at the moment. It&#x27;s being pushed by vendors, presumably because they can gather usage data, push automatic updates, and mobile access is easier to set up with one centralised server rather than using WiFi. There are benefits to doing this, but I think they&#x27;re massively outweighed by the security considerations; it would take a big technological leap from the current models to change that (eg. the widespread use of practical verification; or robust damage limitation mechanisms, like capability models; etc.)", "parent": 10257446.0, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": null, "id": 10258397, "ranking": null, "date": 1442928557000, "year": 2015}, {"by": "brokenhope", "score": null, "time": 1442950278, "timestamp": 1442950278000, "title": "", "type": "comment", "url": "", "text": "End of IOT era again!

(tweet + privmsg could have threatened email)<p>If they would have stepped into this <i>integrative</i> role, by keeping the API access open and available as a building block for third party developers then I think this may be precipitated quite naturally.<p>Just as a small example of what I mean by procotol.. the entire &quot;Internet of things&quot; could likely be running on top of Twitter with the twitter @name serving as the defacto way for your refrigerator to claim it&#x27;s unique global identity and to route messages to your toaster.<p><pre><code>   In addition to kitchen appliances Twitter could largely be serving as the messaging backbone for hundreds of the most popular apps and games if it had opted to embrace the Open Web.  Sure serving as a messaging backbone for the whole world would have put additional burden on their server infrastructure, and it would have allowed third parties to monetize tweets, but it also widens Twitter&#x27;s on-boarding funnel dramatically because it locks myriad diverse products, games, and services into their API.  \n</code></pre>\nMore importantly I think Twitter would have become the defacto Internet Protocol for both notifications and Identity &#x2F; Reputation. It would have meant that new systems wouldn&#x27;t have been able to afford to not integrate with Twitter which contrasts greatly with today&#x27;s situation where none of them can integrate with because of the onerous legal restrictions outlined in the terms.<p><pre><code>  Instead Twitter chose to lock down their API and focus instead on monetizing what traffic they had already captured.  They turned it into an content discovery portal when it could have been a content discovery portal *and* the defacto Internet architecture primitive powering diverse social communities and integrated into just about every network-enabled device on Earth.  After all even the TV news networks were embracing both the @name and the #hashtag.  But then the executives at Twitter somehow decided to dig a moat around the platform, and then a swamp, and then fill it with alligators I mean lawyers, and now in 2015 Twitter has of all things a growth problem.\n\n  I believe that the true hidden potential of the platform lies in Twitter&#x27;s potential role as the world&#x27;s ubiquitous identity and reputation broker.. In other words the @name was more valuable than the tweet.\n\n I think that if somehow the iron fist is relaxed so that the tweets flow open and free then the world at large would learn to embrace the @name as their preferred way to establish digital identity &amp; reputation in place of the fragmented email+linkedin+website that people use today.\n</code></pre>\nI believe that in order to achieve this Twitter should optimize for SCALE rather than revenue.  Restrictive terms are massive friction for scale because they dramatically limit the number of vectors through which any individual can discover the product and engage with it.", "parent": 10372426.0, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": null, "id": 10372806, "ranking": null, "date": 1444630301000, "year": 2015}, {"by": "mangeletti", "score": null, "time": 1444630307, "timestamp": 1444630307000, "title": "", "type": "comment", "url": "", "text": "It&#x27;s interesting.

It may so happen that every critical measurement occurs unbeknownst to the user, before they self-report anything (if at all).

It&#x27;s still quite relevant to all mainstream press outlets, regardless of how TechCrunch or other startup sites feel. Don&#x27;t just ignore press releases. Do them, but do more than JUST press releases. I also have my own non-profit which we do releases for, and you never know when one will land, or how well. Often, random outlets show up interested after a release, even though the big boys ignored it. Do them.<p>tyre hits the nail on the head in stating that TechCrunch is not your market. As a news site, it may be fun to read, but it&#x27;s literally a navel gazing Valley hole where the stories of funding only serve to get more funding. It&#x27;s a cycle, and the more time you spend working to get on TechCrunch, the less time you spend being in the real media, being read about by your potential customers.<p>Customers read other things. Step out of your comfort zone. Maybe instead of TechCrunch writing about your cooking startup, it should be Bon Apetit? Maybe Bon Apetit doesn&#x27;t answer the phone, so you go to the next magazine down. Maybe none of them answer the phone, so you go to Diablo magazine, San Francisco Magazine, or in-flight magazines. There&#x27;s a TON of places to get good press if you look beyond the Web. Radio news programs always need stuff, and local newspapers do too.<p>For these cases, here is what I recommend: find the lowest media point in your industry and call the editor personally. Don&#x27;t have a PR person do it. Don&#x27;t have a marketer do it. Call them as a CEO, or as a VP or whatever you are. Make sure the call is brief, and offer to send them info via email afterwards. But keep calling. Call them back and politely ask about how you could get a story, if they decline. They may only cover product releases, or may only review products. Find out. Maybe they don&#x27;t cover funding news. I don&#x27;t. Few do. It&#x27;s boring as shit.<p>But maybe they&#x27;re doing an article about personal data security, or something on the Internet of Things for their newest issue. You won&#x27;t know unless you call.<p>Through 2 or 3 phone calls, you could get a great story. Work your connections, get to the journalists anyway that doesn&#x27;t involve email as first contact. But be careful. If you get nothing after 2 or 3 calls, stop. Don&#x27;t be a jerk and annoy them.<p>My inbox is filled with releases, well over 100 a day. You literally have less than 1 second per email subject line to catch my eye there before I just mark them all as read and move on to actual work. Those are shitty odds. Maybe I read your release if I know your name and email address, and that catches my eye, but usually that will only work for a C-level or some-such.<p>As for impact pitching... I guess that works. What I look for as a reporter is something new. Novelty goes a very long way.

But the supply-side theory of this business seems like the most compelling (if not wholly complete) theory I&#x27;ve heard.<p>It sounds like you were never in enigneering. You never had to deal with building reliable system in regards of safety and high availability. And you even don&#x27;t know what is really happening in that industry.<p>Just a small example Rollce Royce revolutionized that business years before IT invented the Cloud and XaaS (X as a service). RR is proving flying as a service since years. As an airline, you don&#x27;t buy an airplane with engines. You as an airline decide and tell either Airbus or Boing what engines you like. Then RR (and others these days) don&#x27;t sell you the engine. They sell you flight time. So RR is reponsible that the engines runs without downtimes. RR provide service staff at all major and many minor airports to be able to provide service. RR inventend the Internet of Things way before IT came even close to those ideas. Because to be able to sell airtime, RR needs to know about the status and diagnostics of those engines. Competitors to RR are doing the same since years.<p>Then, a modern aircraft is stuffed with electronics to replace mechanics, like your car. Because mechanics are wheigt. With electronics this weight can be reduced. It also allowed &quot;services&quot; like autonomous flying. Different to the car industry, almost any modern airplane from Airbus and Boing is able to completely fly on its own inclusive take-off and landing. Only taxiing is not possible.<p>But electronics have to problem of requiring redundancy to build highly available systems and all that with limited ressources.

Any implementation that check that bit and drop the packet if the bit is 1 is broken immediately, even if it is not impacted.<p>True story, some years ago I had to design a protocol for remote configuration using text messages. We used a char to send the status in a compact format but in the first version we used only the first 3 bit and we specified that all the other bit should be zero (we have done so in order to have a predictable default in the future and also to increase the readability of the logs). After few months in the field we noticed that using an additional bit would be useful. Don&#x27;t want to go into many details, not a problem if the bit is ignored but nice to have to simplify the operations. We updated the protocol, issued the new specs, the vendors develop the new version, we test the new version and surprise: the IOT between the new server and the old client was broken. Why? Because the designer the implementer of the client was to strict on the must be zero clause and decided that a packet with a one was a corrupt packet and should be dropped.<p>The result was a slow campaign of firmware upgrade and a 1 year delay of introduction of the new protocol. And it was a closed system where we had full control of clients and servers.

There are thousands of air conditioning compressors, refrigeration units, elevators, pumping stations, and other boring but important pieces of infrastructure sending their short messages every few minutes. Often they&#x27;re plain text, something like &quot;Pump 1: OFF. Pump 2: ON. Inside temp: 71. Outside temp: 52. Faults: NONE.&quot;  There are little M2M modules for such communication. They tend to be rugged, reliable, and cost a few hundred dollars.<p>Some of these use cellular service. There are special low-data-rate M2M plans for this. AT&amp;T charges $3.33 a month for 1MB&#x2F;month if you pay by the year.  If you have a protocol that doesn&#x27;t bloat its data traffic by using HTTP, HTTPS, XML, JSON, and other data hogs to send a few bytes of payload, this works out well.<p>There&#x27;s something new called LoRa.[1] This is a standard for low-bandwidth wireless network devices with a claimed 10 mile range. Data rates range from 300 bps to 50 kbps.  They run in the 900MHz ISM band, so they have good building and foliage penetration, although the range then drops to a claimed 2-3 miles. Units start around $56 on Digi-Key.

Today a number of police departments have red light cameras the give no tickets. So you might wonder why they are still there. As it turns out they do an excellent job of watching your license plate go through an intersection and recording that on a server. Add that to police cars with their own license plate readers and GPS and you end up with a cloud of data points, with time and GPS information for places in a city where a license plate has appeared.<p>That provides a very valuable database for law enforcement, if you know a car was used during a robbery, poof you know where that car as been, so you are one up on the robbers. Even if the license plate was stolen or the car stolen, you have it from the point the plate was stolen to the present. The ALCU has been trying to get statements about how long this data is kept and how it is accessed.<p>Today you can recognize faces with machines better than you can with humans. A camera can take pictures and store the face data with no other personally identifiable information, and yet when you suspect someone of something you plug in their face data and &quot;poof&quot; you get all the cameras that have seen them and when.

When you lay a grid of these passive technologies around town, it will become the most powerful tool humans have ever invented for keeping track of, or locating, other humans of interest.<p>The fun part is that private citzens can play too, anyone can put together a fleet of cameras recognizing faces and license plates with a Raspberry Pi 2. And if you have a HackRF One you can pick up GSM bands and WiFi bands to note the phones, tablets, laptops nearby. Call it $400&#x2F;unit, $40,000 for 100 units (two at every intersection would cover an area of 7 square blocks.

A &quot;backdoor&quot; is a coded method to allow bypassing encryption without authorization. That the backdoor may only be exploited after legal due process doesn&#x27;t make it any less of a backdoor. A &quot;backdoor&quot; by definition includes some attempt at making it non-publically accessible (otherwise it would be a front door!)<p>Today, there is a <i>vulnerability</i> that exists on the 5C. If Apple writes the code to enable them to exploit this vulnerability, then they have created the backdoor. Reasonable people may then disagree if the backdoor will remain secure from unlawful use, or if we can even trust the system that Apple and the Government setup together will ensure the backdoor is only used lawfully.<p>The biggest problem I think many people are missing is even if the backdoor is <i>only</i> ever used with &quot;legal due process&quot;, the established legal precedent for getting Apple to create the backdoor would now be &quot;All Writs&quot;. It&#x27;s right there in the name of the law -- now we have a precedent that says, any time the government can show legal due process to want a backdoor created in a device which might possibly assist in some federal investigation, the manufacturer would be required to create such a backdoor for the government. Well, fuck.<p>It seems to me the only logical conclusion is every electronic device you own will be backdoored to have the capability to spy on you. Your car, your phone, your security system, your thermostat, your entire Internet of Things, now all just investigative tools at the governments disposal. I mean, this is already true for all cloud services (see CALEA) but there was at least some hope it would not extend to our own personal property.<p>Now maybe you think Apple actually is capable of creating a backdoor while effectively controlling access. The iPhone is perhaps the most well funded attempt in history to create a truly secure consumer electronic device, and clearly they failed to create a secure 5C, and possibly even failed to fully secure the latest 6S if rumors are true that they can re-flash the secure enclave on a locked device without cycling the encryption keys. Apple ships and patches vulnerabilities just like the rest of us humans. So, I personally wouldn&#x27;t trust even them. But how about every other device manufacturer on the planet?<p>I really hope we don&#x27;t wake up in a few years in this nightmare scenario, but one thing you can be absolutely certain is that this is exactly the game plan. It started with the Clipper chip, and it&#x27;s obvious the careful planning and execution over the last several years to setup this scenario and to try to win over this capability. There are public statements and documented proof that certain officials have been specifically planing to leverage the next available terrorist attack towards these ends. Apple already provided an unencrypted iCloud backup of the device in question! Apple asked for the order to decrypt the device to be put under seal, and the government objected! This is the fight the government has been waiting for.<p>As Senator Frank Church spoke of the NSA, &quot;I know the capacity that is there to make tyranny total in America, and we must see to it that this agency and all agencies that possess this technology operate within the law and under proper supervision, so that we never cross over that abyss. That is the abyss from which there is no return.&quot; I believe the capability for the government to compel creation of backdoors in our personal devices is a bridge into this abyss. It is a capability far too powerful to be controlled from those that believe they are doing the just and Godly work of Protecting the United States of America. In their furious pursuit of ever greater surveillance power, I believe these civil servants are not only recklessly endangering our security and privacy, but paving the road to the destruction of our civil liberties and perhaps even our democracy itself.<p>&quot;The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.&quot; Not every search can be authorized by a warrant, it must also be reasonable. For the safety and security of our citizens, for the preservation of liberty, backdoors to our personal devices should be deemed prima facie <i>unreasonable</i> in any case.<p>Sadly I have very little hope the Supreme Court will lean this way, and I can only see that our security and privacy will suffer greatly as these backdoors are deployed and ultimately exploited.

Here&#x27;s a blurb from a review on Goodreads [1]:<p>Probably the most critical observation to this theory is that information now forms a huge and growing proportion of the goods and services that make up GDP. Yet it is cannot be priced using standard economic theory, which states that a market is in equilibrium when marginal cost equals marginal benefit. Information has zero marginal cost, as it can be copied infinitely, the only cost involved being the electricity this requires. Moreover, the category of information keeps expanding, to include music, books, films, TV shows, patterns and designs to make or do just about any other thing. Whilst there is obviously a cost to producing this information, that is generally also falling. Only legal structures prevent everyone with an internet connection being able to listen to practically every song, watch practically every film, and read practically every book ever created. Realistically, everyone willing to pirate already does. Business models based on defending copyright are fighting a losing battle, as internet connections get faster, storage cheaper, and files quality better. I have long blamed my comfort with media piracy on A-level economics, which helpfully taught me that a good with zero marginal cost should also be priced at zero. Mason notes that the so-called \u2018Internet of Things\u2019 (a concept I am admittedly somewhat dubious of) will expand both the volume and proportion of information in our goods and services. At the moment, the information that we passively create by browsing the web (which certainly feels like a passive activity much of the time) is controlled by state and private monopolies; google and the NSA, broadly. The argument here is all such information should be made more public, in order that it can be used to drive innovation.<p>Apparently the open sourcing of brewery recipes plays into his thesis and gives him another chance to push a short piece on postcapitalism and the opening up of all data&#x2F;information as an equal means of production for everyone in the world.<p>What is not mentioned is the human&#x2F;physical capital required to produce and distribute something of value with this free information, which will still be just as expensive (if not more expensive) in the future.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.goodreads.com&#x2F;book&#x2F;show&#x2F;24878857-postcapitalism\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.goodreads.com&#x2F;book&#x2F;show&#x2F;24878857-postcapitalism</a>", "parent": 11216315.0, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": null, "id": 11216928, "ranking": null, "date": 1457014754000, "year": 2016}, {"by": "avaslas", "score": null, "time": 1457037410, "timestamp": 1457037410000, "title": "", "type": "comment", "url": "", "text": "LinkBee | Sunnyvale, CA &amp; New York, NY | Full-time | Onsite<p>LinkBee is a well funded startup founded in 2015 taking a unique approach to the residential Internet of Things.

When Google was still a start-up that &quot;go&#x2F;no go&quot; decision might be based off of resources or a particular group of programmers passion. Now a mature company, this decision is generally made based on calculations as to how a particular project will fit into the overall portfolio and impact the bottom line.<p>Some projects, no matter how much a passionate group of programmers might lobby, may never get off the ground because there isn&#x27;t a sufficient argument in terms of the larger picture. But, and here I finally get to my point, some projects are surely proposed purely to protect the bottom line from competitors or to hedge against changes in the marketplace; i.e. Google+ was purely to protect against the trend of Facebook becoming a growing percentage of a user&#x27;s on-line experience and walling off content to Google&#x27;s search engine.<p>Another example, still unfolding, is that of their Nest acquisition. And this is where the real damage gets done. Google sees the growth of the IOT market, and so acquires Nest so as to get a foothold into that market.<p>Now both Google+ and Nest are dying horrible, slow, shot in the stomach movie deaths, and everyone is forced to watch.

Developers of the device just focus on the device, we take care of the rest.<p>3. Data Analytics: Sensors&#x2F;Devices just send their data; We perform complex data analytics on them.<p>4. Interconnection: You can do trigger actions on the devices you own (in real time) - for example, if temp in antartica weather station is less than 30, email me or turn on light at home, etc . All this with no programming.<p>Use Cases:\n1. Companies make internal phone apps all the time. In the future, they are going to make internal IOT devices and they need a platform for that. We are that.<p>2. You have an idea for an IOT device, use our service to create the device - you focus on the device coz the backend, website, phone app is all done. Scale from 1 to a million.<p>3. You own a company and need a custom IOT device - you need to hire a h&#x2F;w designer, backend developer, phone app developer, maintain a server etc. Use Connyct and you only need someone to send us the data - may be an intern?

It&#x27;s expensive, yes - you get industrial-quality products and a solution designed (and priced) for your particular needs. Basically, I&#x27;m talking about companies that were doing IoT for the past two decades, long before anyone ever thought of that acronym. I have a few observations:<p>- Everyone does exactly the same thing. HVAC, alarms, lights, window blinds, access control. There isn&#x27;t really much more to sensibly automate at home for an ordinary person at this moment. So they try to differentiate by look&amp;feel, UI and the type of installation - e.g. whether it can be laid over an existing building easily, or whether it would require to dig up the entire electrical installation and is therefore best done during construction or big renovation.<p>- Everything runs local first. As it should. Most solutions are wired, some are wireless - via Zigbee, LoRa, Wi-Fi, or some protocol, but still over a local network. Cloud services are often added to enable remote viewing and management via mobile devices, but this is a bonus, not the core thing in the installation. One company I talked with today ensured me that their pretty mobile apps &#x2F; tablet control panels have configurable network URL, so you can expose your automation server however you like or <i>not at all</i> - just point the app to an IP in your local network.<p>- A typical setup is expected to work fully locally and is resilient. In many cases, even if your central server goes down, your &quot;smart&quot; wall switches still work and control the stuff.<p>- The business model is honest. You submit your needs, get a quote for the installation, and when you decide to go ahead then the company comes, set things up, and it&#x27;s done. No silly recurrent fees, no bullshit subscriptions. You bought the hardware, it&#x27;s yours.<p>So basically, it works as it <i>should</i>. It&#x27;s not hot and sexy (most of your installation will be hidden in the walls anyway), but it is reliable and it is honest. It&#x27;s how grownups do business. Contrast that with the startup IoT bullshit.<p>As some of HNers mentioned already over the last few months, what we need is not Internet of Things, but an <i>Intranet</i> of Things. Exposing all that data to cloud by default is user-hostile and bad engineering. Adding a subscription-based business model on top of that is literally screwing people over.

All designs have pros and cons. Also, I realize I&#x27;m nit picking, but there&#x27;s a couple inaccuracies in what you&#x27;ve said:<p>I&#x27;m not sure where you&#x27;re getting the significantly more processing power; particularly if you&#x27;re comparing to lighthouse. General image processing can add latency, but they&#x27;ve constrained the tracking problem, and it currently doesn&#x27;t heavily utilize the CPU [1] . You can perform similar tracking cheaply with an ASIC like castAR does [2]. Lighthouse still has to perform sensor fusion with different time stamps for the tracker locations as I previously mentioned, which can also be processor intensive. I haven&#x27;t done or seen any CPU usage comparisons between the two, but I believe they&#x27;d be comparable.<p>You are limited by the resolution of the camera, but you can still get subpixel accuracy when tracking. With lighthouse, you don&#x27;t exactly get infinite resolution either, but I do think lighthouse takes the cake here. Once again though, it&#x27;s the IMU that ultimately determines the accuracy.<p>Lighthouse being untethered is one of the more exciting things to me as it lends itself well to doing tracking in large event spaces.<p>The limiting factor for lighthouse isn&#x27;t whether the laser is in range, but whether the LEDs are in range. In between each laser sweep, the IR LEDs flash, so that the tracking points know when to start timing [3]. I believe they&#x27;ve improved the distance of this flash in the consumer Vive, but they will still limit the distance.<p>Adding base stations does help improve accuracy, just as it does with constellation, but it won&#x27;t improve precision. It only helps prevent issues with occlusion. However, adding more base stations won&#x27;t improve the precision of the tracking device&#x27;s location.<p>I believe the current lighthouse systems are still technically limited to two base stations, because of how they are time multiplexed. They&#x27;re planning on frequency multiplexing which should allow this to grow without having to connect the base stations.<p>Also, lighthouse is susceptible to IR interference in ways that constellation isn&#x27;t. They both utilize IR for their tracking, but since each tracker in the constellation system flashes a pattern, it&#x27;s able to eliminate environmental IR. Lighthouse doesn&#x27;t have a direct way to prevent IR interference that I&#x27;m aware of other than accounting for potential errors in their pose estimation.<p>Lighthouse also has moving parts, so there&#x27;s a chance for mechanical failure. The motors are manufactured by Nidec [4] who are one of the largest manufacturers of hard drive motors, so they should be very high quality, but it is a potential point of failure.<p>Lastly, your statement &quot;while this might be possible with the rift, the experience is likely not going to be as good as the Vive, and may be quite poor at times,&quot; seems to be entirely speculation. There are several tests with both single and multiple cameras that have performed room scale tracking exceptionally well. [5] [6] [7]<p>These are both great technologies that have their own strengths and weaknesses. I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s one objective winner here. That being said, I&#x27;m looking forward to the updates to lighthouse that they&#x27;ve been talking about to make lighthouse viable for large event spaces, and I could even see a day where other IOT objects utilize lighthouse for tracking in ways that wouldn&#x27;t be possible with constellation.<p>[1] <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;uploadvr.com&#x2F;oculus-cv1-positional-camera-efficient&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;uploadvr.com&#x2F;oculus-cv1-positional-camera-efficient&#x2F;</a>\n[2] <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theamphour.com&#x2F;transcript-of-episode-147-absorptive-augmented-actuality&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theamphour.com&#x2F;transcript-of-episode-147-absorpti...</a>\n[3] <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pcper.com&#x2F;reviews&#x2F;General-Tech&#x2F;SteamVR-HTC-Vive-depth-Lighthouse-Tracking-System-Dissected-and-Explored&#x2F;SteamV\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pcper.com&#x2F;reviews&#x2F;General-Tech&#x2F;SteamVR-HTC-Vive-d...</a>\n[4] <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nidec.com&#x2F;en-Global&#x2F;product&#x2F;news&#x2F;2016&#x2F;news0108-01&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nidec.com&#x2F;en-Global&#x2F;product&#x2F;news&#x2F;2016&#x2F;news0108-01...</a>\n[5] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=l_HlXzELHgo\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=l_HlXzELHgo</a>\n[6] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=cXrJu-zOzm4\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=cXrJu-zOzm4</a>\n[7] <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;uploadvr.com&#x2F;room-scale-possible-testing-the-standing-tracking-volume-on-the-oculus-rift&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;uploadvr.com&#x2F;room-scale-possible-testing-the-standing...</a>", "parent": 11498159.0, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": null, "id": 11500913, "ranking": null, "date": 1460674516000, "year": 2016}, {"by": "akosicristina", "score": 1.0, "time": 1460682080, "timestamp": 1460682080000, "title": "How This Entrepreneur Built an Agency for an Internet of Things World", "type": "story", "url": "http://www.conversionaid.com/podcast/marcelino-alvarez-uncorked-studios/", "text": "", "parent": null, "deleted": null, "dead": true, "descendants": null, "id": 11501398, "ranking": null, "date": 1460682080000, "year": 2016}, {"by": "kahwooi", "score": null, "time": 1460703506, "timestamp": 1460703506000, "title": "", "type": "comment", "url": "", "text": "What IOT platform and library are you using when using NodeJS?", "parent": 11502644.0, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": null, "id": 11502668, "ranking": null, "date": 1460703506000, "year": 2016}, {"by": "studentrob", "score": null, "time": 1460794795, "timestamp": 1460794795000, "title": "", "type": "comment", "url": "", "text": "I agree voting from your IOT device is something that should happen.

We are currently working on our first range of desks, storage and functional office furniture to balance a combination of design innovation, research and IOT (internet of things).<p>The aim is to deliver beautiful yet functional furniture that will enhance any office environment. Our products are made locally, reducing the environmental impact of transport and logistics. We always recommend using wooden sheet materials from sustainable, FSC-certified sources.<p>Designed to made furniture on demand, Modoola products cut out the middlemen and logistics of global supply chains. Providing a more direct and personalised experience, customers still gain all the benefits of designer furniture without the long lead times and costly price tag. This approach cuts the delivery and lead time of a designer fit out to 1-4 weeks, as opposed to the 8-12 weeks typically quoted by traditional suppliers.<p>The key elements in our first hexagonal desk are simplicity of aesthetics and functionality, with options to suit any environment. Desks come in 3 min width: 120cm, 150cm and 180cm, allowing offices to maximise space.<p>Because our furniture is made on-demand, it can be personalised to your brand and environment, for example by milling your logo into the design.

Currently, the agent is written in Python and has been tested with the Raspberry Pi.\nOnce the agent is installed, the device can be deployed on the field.

Which kind of facilities exists that could provide a good groundwork for cooperation&#x2F;investment?\nHearing this news that a creative project has managed to provide his required capital in Kickstarter may not look so bizarre. But in a country like Iran that crowdfunding is only a three-year-old subject and has started from donation and charity projects, the fact that a project on the domain of Internet of things absorbs his capital in this way and thinks about mass production simultaneously is a big achievement. Findima is a gadget that helps people to not lose their belongings simply by sending alarms to their cell phones. The young generation in Iran is remarkably creative. Nowadays, the disappearing of the borders as a result of the global village has enabled few Iranian to stand out at management level among tech giants. Due to the imposed economic sanctions on Iran, the young generation inside Iran faced with many restrictions which did not give the opportunity to mobilize their ideas.\nAlong all these years, only a few projects from Iran had this opportunity to be supported by gigantic companies. Findima is one of these pioneer projects with a restrictive access to devices and foreign platforms, which the completion of their entire project is their own work; however, their access may seem so simple for you. What distinguishes Findima from similar projects in Iran is providing its required budget through an Iranian platform called 2nate by crowdfunding (http:&#x2F;&#x2F;2n8.ir&#x2F;Zd). The story of Findima, has inspired this hope in Iranian technology market that not only their creativeness, knowledge and expertise of the Iranian young generation in international firms can be used but also if they would be given a chance, they are capable of presenting their products with remarkable qualities to compete in international markets.", "parent": null, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": 2.0, "id": 11892664, "ranking": null, "date": 1465811568000, "year": 2016}, {"by": "jesusmrv", "score": 2.0, "time": 1465818387, "timestamp": 1465818387000, "title": "Steve Case Is Right About the Third Wave and the Blockchain and IOT Proves It", "type": "story", "url": "https://medium.com/@jrodthoughts/steve-case-is-right-about-the-third-wave-and-the-blockchain-and-iot-proves-it-2beaecb7afe8#.wv3v5dhcr", "text": "", "parent": null, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": 2.0, "id": 11892999, "ranking": null, "date": 1465818387000, "year": 2016}, {"by": "bliptrack", "score": 6.0, "time": 1465887242, "timestamp": 1465887242000, "title": "How IOT Helped CVG Airport Cut TSA Wait Times", "type": "story", "url": "https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-iot-helped-cvg-airport-cut-tsa-wait-times-carstens", "text": "", "parent": null, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": 0.0, "id": 11900251, "ranking": null, "date": 1465887242000, "year": 2016}, {"by": "jesusmrv", "score": 1.0, "time": 1465905731, "timestamp": 1465905731000, "title": "Steve Case Is Right About the Third Wave and the Blockchain and IOT Proves It", "type": "story", "url": "https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/steve-case-right-third-wave-blockchain-iot-proves-jesus-rodriguez?trk=mp-reader-card", "text": "", "parent": null, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": 0.0, "id": 11901414, "ranking": null, "date": 1465905731000, "year": 2016}, {"by": "laumars", "score": null, "time": 1465969252, "timestamp": 1465969252000, "title": "", "type": "comment", "url": "", "text": "Because an open web means the freedom to choose which browser you want to use.

Upgrades will be applied automatically.&quot;  You as a hacker can turn it off to instead get the behavior you suggest.<p>If the user does not disable that option:<p>-&gt; By default devices should ping to see if their company wants to push an update.<p>-&gt; If there&#x27;s nothing to ping because their companies have gone out of business or the product is no longer supported, then they should stay on their current version and NOT stop working or be bricked.  A Nest-like debacle shouldn&#x27;t happen.  Devices shouldn&#x27;t be bricked by an end to support.<p>-&gt;  If the device has its ping answered it should download the update and check that it is signed with a key in its list of accepted keys, however, only if it successfully reaches a revocation server and the revocation server does not say the key is revoked.  It should have a set of possible keys, and if they have all been revoked then it should never apply another automatic update.  If it can&#x27;t reach the revocation server it should never apply an update.<p>-&gt;  Since you&#x27;re a hacker you can just add a file to the filesystem into the list of keys.  This is fine because anyone who can read your device&#x27;s filesystem in person can already do anything, such as replace the contents of the file after it has been checked, verified, and decrypted, but before being run.  So this is not a vector that concerns us.  This means that code-signing doesn&#x27;t destroy anything of your own control over your own device, nor place an inordinate burden on you.<p>-&gt;  Once a signed update has been received it will just be run as root regardless of its contents.<p>In practice what the scripts should do is copy the current filesystem to an Updated filesystem, then use the scripts to modify the Updated filesystem.   It should then issue a reboot command and the device firmware should attempt to reboot into the Updated filesystem.  If successful and tests pass then the Updated filesystem becomes Current.  If it fails then after a while the firmware will reboot to the old version.  The device in this case (via scripts) reports to the server, by encrypting with the non-revoked key, that its update failed.  It will then go back to pinging for updates as normal.  The server can choose whether and when to push another update, or what other update to push.  So if devices in the field are failing to update then the server operator can turn off the push of the updates and fix the problem.<p>That&#x27;s it.   This is the architecture that I envision.<p>What do you think?  It&#x27;s the exact OPPOSITE conclusion from the one you&#x27;ve reached.  It is far, far beyond the line in the sand that you&#x27;ve drawn.<p>But <i>your</i> line in the sand means you want the benefits of upgrades, but you want your non-technical dad (or mom), grandparent, non-technical boyfriend or girlfriend, cousin, all the people buying the device and driving the price down for you, not to enjoy upgrade benefits.<p>Are you <i>sure</i> this is what you want?

Their site officially says[2] their solution &quot;is a network ideal for Internet of Things (IoT), metering, security, asset tracking, and machine-to-machine (M2M) applications.&quot; So while a great solution for, say, plopping down a few thousand soil hydrometers, it&#x27;s not going to help with the over-saturation of the 4G networks.<p>``1&#x27;&#x27;: Spectrum efficiency varies as a function of carrier wave length[3 for a brief overview] There&#x27;s an information theory limit as to how much data you can effectively transport (throughput, not latency) limited by the Shannon-Hartley limit.

Also interesting hearing you mention you\nwere using plumtree for your replication backend.<p>To elaborate more on your point, CRDTs are super helpful while trying to distribute a lot of devices,\nbut they only get you so far. While building Lasp[0][1], a distributed data-flow language using CRDTs,\nwe found out a lot of scalability problems with naive usage of CRDTs. We are aiming to reach 10k-20k nodes\nin the near future, so we are focusing a lot on reducing network usage.<p>State-based CRDTs send their full state to all their peers, which works ok when your states are small, but\nthey introduce lots of overhead in any other case. Operation-based CRDTs only send the actions performed\non it (add 1, or rmv 2, for example), but these are not idempotent and require a lot of guarantees from \nthe underlying distribution backend.<p>We are focusing on using Delta CRDTs, that combine the low network usage of operation-based structures,\nwith the idempotence of state-based approaches.<p>Using plumtree for your backend makes it resilient to network failures, but using the default full\nmembership protocol makes it almost unusable when you&#x27;re dealing with a big number of nodes. Using\nalternative protocols like Hyparview greatly reduces the number of protocol messages in your network.<p>Finally, since Lasp is a data-flow language, we are applying control-flow analysis to select and remove\nunused or intermediate values in the program, thus also reducing network usage.<p>[0]: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;lasp-lang.org&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;lasp-lang.org&#x2F;</a>\n[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;lasp-lang&#x2F;lasp\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;lasp-lang&#x2F;lasp</a>", "parent": 12110306.0, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": null, "id": 12110947, "ranking": null, "date": 1468777247000, "year": 2016}, {"by": "ssimunic", "score": 1.0, "time": 1468797461, "timestamp": 1468797461000, "title": "Internet of Things data platform for temperature and humidity sensors with maps", "type": "story", "url": "https://github.com/ssimunic/Temp-Monitor", "text": "", "parent": null, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": 0.0, "id": 12112376, "ranking": null, "date": 1468797461000, "year": 2016}, {"by": "dbcooper", "score": null, "time": 1468808663, "timestamp": 1468808663000, "title": "", "type": "comment", "url": "", "text": "The FT claims that the deal has been done for \u00a323.4bn.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;next.ft.com&#x2F;content&#x2F;0cc23483-7681-3018-8e9d-80c2dd77fbda\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;next.ft.com&#x2F;content&#x2F;0cc23483-7681-3018-8e9d-80c2dd77...</a><p>&gt;Japan\u2019s SoftBank has agreed to acquire Arm Holdings, the UK\u2019s preeminent technology company, for \u00a323.4bn in an enormous bet by the Japanese telecoms group that the smartphone chip designer will make it a leader in one of the next big tech markets, the internet of things.<p>Apparently that is a 40% premium on market cap.

My email is in sync 100% of the time between 4-5 different computers and devices of different brands and OSs. Dropbox takes care of my personal files, box.com of those for work. I frequently collaborate on documents in both Google Docs and Quip. Not too long ago, transferring files between Mac and Windows was hard (I think macs had a proprietary compression program that wasn&#x27;t available on windows?) - luckily that&#x27;s <i>entirely</i> in the past. USB is ubiquitous, FireWire, PS&#x2F;2, ADB, serial, all gone. A Mac keyboard works on a Windows box, and vice-versa. Bluetooth definitely has kinks, but it also has a lot of &quot;just works&quot; along <i>very</i> long stretches. With a few annoying exceptions, people using Linux, Macs and Windows can work together seamlessly. Websites (with a few annoying exceptions) generally works well in all major browsers on all major platforms, on desktop, tablets or mobile (both IOS, Android and Microsoft). I got a new wifi-printer a few days ago - after joining to the network, it was automatically available on our computers. Took maybe five minutes, no messing about with IP addresses and drivers.<p>I can cast to a ChromeCast on my TV from my Mac, my Android and random guests iPhones (I can also &quot;cast&quot; Youtube directly to the TVs Youtube app, but it&#x27;s pretty flaky -- and this is some fancy standard, as opposed to the ChromeCast, it&#x27;s just that Sony is shit at implementing the standard). I can play music from Spotify from my laptop or smartphone on a Denon speaker in the kitchen, a &quot;GramoFon&quot; wifi-sound-device attached to my &quot;dumb&quot; stereo and my dad&#x27;s &quot;smart&quot; Marantz stereo.<p>Interoperability is doing fine, but yes, it&#x27;s messier than it might have been if some magic omniscient body had come up with clean standards for all this.

A coworker lives a few miles from the navy base in Bremerton, Washington, and a couple times a year they do some radio testing that completely blocks his garage door opener. His garage only has the one door, and it has no manual override from outside, so when this happens his car is stuck there until the navy finishes testing.<p>This is an area where IOT makes some sense. If you use an unlicensed frequency using the rule that allows use of such frequencies as long as power is very low, you risk some licensed user legally operating with much more power will stomp all over you, as is the case with the navy.<p>If you use IOT, that is much less likely. The frequencies used by WiFi are primarily allocated to other services, and so there is some risk that someone will legally stomp all over your WiFi, that risk is a lot less.<p>First, WiFi bands start at 2.4 GHz and go up from there. At those frequencies range is much more limited than it is at lower frequencies such as those typically used in current garage door openers. So even if someone is doing something high powered on those frequencies, it will likely only wipe out WiFi in a small area, rather than for many miles around.<p>Second, WiFi is widespread enough that those who might interfere probably use WiFi themselves, and so might be inclined to use some other frequencies available to them so as to not wipe out their own WiFi.<p>Similar arguments apply to cellular internet, but more strongly because in the case of cellular, I believe the cellular companies are the users who have priority for those frequencies.<p>This, an IOT garage door opener, connected on your home WiFi, that you can access via your cell phone from your car either via the cell phone using your home access point of over your cellular service, seems like it would possibly be the way to go nowadays (assuming you can secure the damn thing reasonably).<p>In the case specifically of garage door openers, though, I&#x27;d also consider doing it optically or ultrasonically, instead of via radio.", "parent": 12340034.0, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": null, "id": 12340189, "ranking": null, "date": 1471908939000, "year": 2016}, {"by": "ohjeez", "score": 1.0, "time": 1471964127, "timestamp": 1471964127000, "title": "The Internet of Things and the city of tomorrow", "type": "story", "url": "https://www.researchgate.net/blog/post/iot-and-the-city-of-tomorrow", "text": "", "parent": null, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": 0.0, "id": 12344195, "ranking": null, "date": 1471964127000, "year": 2016}, {"by": "Nelkins", "score": null, "time": 1471975360, "timestamp": 1471975360000, "title": "", "type": "comment", "url": "", "text": "As with any platform there are strengths and weaknesses.  In my mind, the greatest strength of the .NET framework is the sheer number of ways you can leverage your .NET knowledge to create various types of products.  For example:<p>1. Desktop GUI applications.  WPF is in my opinion the best GUI framework for Windows, and many well-known Linux GUI apps have been made with Mono + GTK.  You can even create Mac GUI apps with Xamarin.Mac (with commercial support!).<p>2. Server&#x2F;web software.  ASP.NET MVC, ASP.NET WebAPI, NancyFX, Suave...the list goes on for various frameworks (most of which will run on Windows, Linux, and OS X).<p>3. Video games.  Unity is very commonly used.<p>4. Internet of things.  You can run .NET on a Raspberry Pi, and on various other embedded devices (again, with commercial support!).<p>5. Mobile apps.  You can write iOS and Android applications using Xamarin.  In my opinion, it&#x27;s the best tool to write native, cross-platform mobile apps (when considering tooling, enterprise support, etc.).<p>Some other great points:<p>1. C# and F# are generally considered to be very-well designed languages that support a variety of programming styles.<p>2. .NET has very broad adoption in enterprise.

It is sometimes possible to distribute GPL binaries without incurring any source obligation, and I suspect that this is going to be come a lot more common as IOT devices become more popular. For example, Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart, and others sell assorted consumer products, such as televisions and routers, that contain Linux-based firmware, but they do not have any obligation to provide the source.<p>All they are doing is receiving boxes of televisions and routers and other goods from the manufacturers (or from the distributors who receive them from the manufacturers), and then selling those items to the consumer on a one to one basis. A copy of Linux comes in to them embedded in some physical thing, such as the FLASH memory in a television or router, and they sell that particular physical hardware and that particular copy of Linux to a consumer. The first sale doctrine, which pretty much every major country I believe has in some form in its copyright law, says that doing this does not require permission of the copyright owner. If you aren&#x27;t doing anything with GPL code that requires permission of the copyright owner, GPL has no power over you.<p>Right now, I don&#x27;t think this is a big issue because usually you can find out who does have an obligation to provide the code. Buy a television or router from Best Buy, and it will be from some reasonably prominent manufacturer, such as Samsung or Netgear, and that manufacturer probably is the one who was actually making copies and putting them on the device. They have the obligation to provide source, and they usually have some reasonable way to contract support and find out how and where to actually get it.<p>I think this may change as IOT becomes more common. I think we&#x27;ll see several companies that make generic IOT base platforms, which they sell to companies that want to make IOT devices for specific applications. Those companies will add their software to the software of the base device, and hook up the specific sensors and actuators needed for their application.<p>A technically sensible way to make the generic base platforms is to make a Linux-based system that has the kernel and the standard utilities on a root partition in FLASH memory, and has a memory card slot. Upon startup have the init system wait for a memory card to be inserted that contains a valid filesystem, mount that filesystem on &#x2F;home, and then look for &#x2F;home&#x2F;iot&#x2F;startup.sh. If that exists, it becomes the iot user and runs &#x2F;home&#x2F;iot&#x2F;startup.sh.<p>Companies that use this generic base to build their IOT device do not have to modify or copy the kernel or anything else on the root partition. All of their code lives on that separate memory card, as user mode applications and scripts. These companies, when they want to make a manufacturing run of, say, 5000 devices, would buy 5000 units of the generic IOT base system, build and connect 5000 of their sensor and actuator modules, insert 5000 copies of their user mode application and script memory card, and ship the 5000 devices out to customers, distributors, and stores.<p>So you go to Best Buy and buy one of these things and want source code to the Linux contained therein, what do you do? If you ask Best Buy, they say they just passed on the box they received, and point you to the manufacturer listed on the box. When you contact them, they say the same thing...they just bought these generic Linux IOT bases, and plugged in their hardware modules and inserted their memory cards (which contain no GPL software), and if they are feeling nice they tell you the name of the company that made the IOT base. If they are not feeling nice, or they consider information like who their suppliers are to be a trade secret, they may decline to tell you where they got the base platform, and you are pretty much stuck.<p>It could even get worse, because I suspect that in some markets there may be multiple layers of this. You&#x27;ll have at the bottom layer companies making a fairly generic Linux-based system for embedded use. At a layer above them you&#x27;ll have companies that take those generic systems and partially specialize them for particular industries or fields or activities. They may add special hardware interfaces, put them in rugged cases, or things like that. A layer up from that would be the companies that turn these into products for end users.<p>And that isn&#x27;t even the worst it can get. It is actually possible to get a GPL binary commercially that <i>nobody</i> has obligation to provide source for. That&#x27;s because GPLv2 provides two ways to satisfy your source code obligation if you commercially distribute a GPL binary:<p>1. Include the source when you distribute binary.<p>2. Provide a written offer, valid for at least three years, to provide the source to any third party who requests it.<p>Suppose the maker of the generic IOT base device, the one that has Linux on its root filesystem and on startup tries to mount the memory card and run the user mode application found there, includes in each box a CD-ROM that contains the source for all the software on the root filesystem. (That&#x27;s what I would do...I&#x27;d rather go to the slight added trouble up front of adding a CD-ROM to the shipment now and be done with it than have to deal with it spread out over several years).<p>Their customer, the company that is making, say, an IOT nose hair trimmer, doesn&#x27;t care about those CD-ROMs. They just want to add their hair length sensor module, and their clipper module, insert their memory card with their software, package it all up nicely, and ship it off to the retailers. They toss the CD-ROMs in the trash.<p>You buy one of these nose hair trimmers. Who is obligated to give you the source? How about the generic IOT base device maker? Nope. Every GPL binary they shipped was accompanied by the complete source code, so they satisfied their GPL obligation.<p>How about the nose hair trimmer company? Nope. They are just shipping out copies they received, and are covered by the first sale doctrine.<p>If this becomes common enough for the FSF to see it as an issue that needs to be addressed in GPLv4, it will be interesting to see if they can come up with a good solution. The basic problem is that the option to satisfy your GPL obligation by including the source with the binary extinguishes your obligation in regard to that binary without guaranteeing that when the recipient of that binary redistributes that they will incur a source obligation (because first sale provides a situation in which they can distribute without incurring any copyright obligation).<p>Offhand, I only see one way to address this. Make it so that if you distribute a GPL binary (in a way that required copyright owner permission) then you must provide source to any third party that requests it. Back when GPLv2 was written, that could have been quite onerous, because distributing source usually meant sending a tape. Nowadays, distributing only is easy, and there are plenty of free hosting services for source code, so it probably wouldn&#x27;t be too onerous. Still, that would be a pretty big change, and I think a lot of people would be very upset at the &quot;fire and forget&quot; option that &quot;include the source code when you distribute the binary&quot; provides.<p>Anyone see any other ways to address this?", "parent": 12406116.0, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": null, "id": 12407678, "ranking": null, "date": 1472754334000, "year": 2016}, {"by": "Theresep", "score": null, "time": 1472760276, "timestamp": 1472760276000, "title": "", "type": "comment", "url": "", "text": "FogHorn Systems is an early stage startup driven by the passion to significantly disrupt and invent in the space of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIOT).

There are two big anchor stores, Facebook and Google, at either end. There\u2019s an Apple store in the middle, along with a Sharper Image where they are trying to sell us the Internet of Things. A couple of punk kids hang out in the food court, but they don&#x27;t really make trouble. This mall is well-policed and has security cameras everywhere. And you guys are the bookmobile in the parking lot, put there to try to make it classy.<p>It&#x27;s already been mentioned, but this guy needs to get out a bit more.<p>The internet is a city. There&#x27;s the specialist shops (HN), the bustling malls (Reddit, YT), the shady back alleys (4chan, 8chan etc.), the historical districts (Usenet, Archive.org), the cafes (IRC, ICQ, Slack, etc.). To their credit, the author is more knowledgeable than most, however.<p>I see so many dismiss the internet as just Facebook, or YouTube, discuss trolling as if it&#x27;s a single phenomenon, and it&#x27;s a recent thing, associated with Social Media. So many think that there&#x27;s an internet culture: there isn&#x27;t: there&#x27;s a set of almost infinite numbers of overlapping, interlinked cultures. I can even map out the origins and historical influences of a few. There are even a few who think that social media sites are good forums of discussion. The poor sods: the Usenet was a better discussion forum than Facebook ever was, and the Usenet&#x27;s not that great.<p>If you really want to see what the internet is like (that isn&#x27;t advice for the author: I&#x27;m pretty sure the mall analogy doesn&#x27;t encompass his internet experience, and is merely an analogue I find odd), explore. See it all, in all of its weird, wacky, zany, jokey, serious, offensive, manic, smart, stupid, brilliant, insane glory. I promise you, you won&#x27;t be dissapointed.<p>People ask me why I&#x27;m not on social media. It&#x27;s because social media is boring. Unlike Reddit, 4chan, and the rest, not much interesting happens. Unlike HN, I&#x27;m not likely to be intellectually stimulated, or learn something new. Unlike static sites, I don&#x27;t get to see that kind of wild creativeness that personal webspace tends to invite in hackers, nerds, and others who know what makes the web tick. I don&#x27;t want to see what you ate, I don&#x27;t want to see your cat, I don&#x27;t want to hear banal details about your everyday life. I want to hear something intersting, new, and original. I want to hear the next Ze Frank, or Tom Ridgewell, or Simon Travaglia, or Steve Yegge, or RMS, or PG, or Ryan Dahl, and you can bet I won&#x27;t on a site with a signal:noise ratio that high.<p>People also ask why I&#x27;m fascinated with the internet. My response is, why wouldn&#x27;t I be? It&#x27;s a catalogue of decades of human creativity and interaction. It&#x27;s open mike night at the largest club in the world, which is also a discussion forum, and a shady back alley, and a convention. It is - to borrow and butcher Sir Terry&#x27;s words - like being blindfolded and drunk at several different parties at once.<p>But, in what it rapidly becoming the sign-off on my incoherent, long-winded ramblings that are really only tangentially connected to the topic at hand, maybe I&#x27;m just totally mad.<p>EDIT: tried to clarify that I wasn&#x27;t trying to insult the author. Not my intent, but it seemed to come off that way. It still does, but less so, and I prefer not to edit my old content too much. Also, I just checked out pinboard.

Internet of Things will also increase the amount of additional data being fed to the car&#x27;s computer, e.g. it will know exactly when a traffic light is about to turn red because they will receive this data directly from it.<p>Once you reach a certain critical percentage of fully autonomous vehicles regulation will probably change to such an extent that car insurers will void your insurance if you drive it manually, or give a significant discount to your insurance premium if you don&#x27;t ever put it in &quot;manual&quot; mode, etc.<p>I think the problem is really difficult right now because humans are still allowed to drive, but as that ratio goes down it becomes less of a serious problem.", "parent": 12751311.0, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": null, "id": 12753986, "ranking": null, "date": 1476982418000, "year": 2016}, {"by": "100ideas", "score": null, "time": 1477016968, "timestamp": 1477016968000, "title": "", "type": "comment", "url": "", "text": "Go go armlinux Internet of Things bot army!", "parent": 12756006.0, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": null, "id": 12757775, "ranking": null, "date": 1477016968000, "year": 2016}, {"by": "Animats", "score": null, "time": 1477035640, "timestamp": 1477035640000, "title": "", "type": "comment", "url": "", "text": "Who&#x27;s big and a steady money-loser?

Instead, the industry seems to be running after seemingly low-hanging fruit  that on closer look are not even fruit at all: Their products seem driven by what is easily doable with today&#x27;s technology and what data the vendor would like to collect. Whether the use-case that the product satisfies actually exists seems to be unimportant. Then people are surprised if such products don&#x27;t sell.<p>My favourite example is the wifi-enabled water boiler: I could imagine a lot of tasks that involve boiling water and that I&#x27;d love to automate: If you live alone and could walke up to an already prepared cup of tea&#x2F;coffee&#x2F;porridge would be nice. Yet the makes of that product chose to automate the one aspect of those tasks where automation brings the least benefit: Flicking the switch on the water boiler.<p>I believe when we&#x27;re capable of building a &quot;laundry bucket&#x2F;washer&#x2F;dryer&#x2F;wardrobe&quot; combo where you put your dirty laundry in the bucket and it magically ends up in your wardrobe the next day, smart homes will become useful.

Users always have their phones with them. This suggests that assistant control should be done via the phone, rather than through fixed hubs around the house.<p>3. General AI is more akin to a limit point, rather than some attainable state.<p>4. Users need to be able to interface with training processes of their assistant to create more personalized interactions.

Here are my conclusions so far:<p>* Eco-System Value\n  The contributors to the most recent RISC-V workshop [0] are an impressive list, there are sure to be lessons to be learned by all involved. R&amp;D folks have a new, rich eco-system in which to explore new micro- and macro-level architecture optimization concepts. Vendors have, potentially, a head start on feeding new commercial interest. I rate this value five out-of five stars (<i></i><i></i><i>)<p></i> Performance Value\n  Related to eco-system, and perhaps why you&#x27;re seeing interest among cloud service providers, is that the industry workloads are changing. Intel, Qualcomm and others are certainly focused on this too, but perhaps RISC-V can be a game changer. In the same way that Tesla up-ended the automotive market by delivering new technology directly to consumers without the typical supply chain burden, Google, Facebook, Alibaba, Amazon (ie., hyperscalers) and perhaps Tesla too can find value in new SOC architectures which they directly design. I rate this currently at two out of five, for potential (<i></i>...)<p>* Cost Savings Value\n  I hear your concerns about the overhead of IP licensing, but don&#x27;t blame the vendors: you folks purchasing IP ask for unlimited indemnification and ECO&#x27;s -- it&#x27;s crazy. And of course a CPU does not an SOC make, you&#x27;ll still need plenty of additional IP (even lowly USB cores!) to develop an SOC. Plus, while I&#x27;m sure the LLVM&#x2F;GDB tooling is better than it used to be, if RISC-V becomes poplar the commercial tools will follow. One star (<i>....)<p></i> IP Terms\n  The whisper in the industry for years has been that &#x27;ARM&#x2F;Intel glom critical design ideas from customers which they roll into future cores to sell to competitors.&#x27; Perhaps, rather than fighting this, RISC-V can allow all of us to embrace this type of collaboration? Hard to see it now, and I don&#x27;t think Son-san should write-down his ARM acquisition costs just yet, but the &quot;CPU is just another core&quot; could push the industry forward. Intel becomes a compute-cloud provider. Qualcomm the IOT mesh provider. NVIDIA the AI services provider. And the rest of us focus on software differentiation!

Intel could create their own chip for that instruction set and get it running at 4Ghz with your latest fab facility. At the other extreme I could sit at home and use Verilog to create a soft core that is downloaded to an FPGA and be up and running with a much slower implementation). Neither of us has to pay anyone for the right to do so and the code we write should work on both because it adheres to the same standard.<p>In contrast, if you want to create an ARM or x86 processor then you have to pay a license fee. Even if you implement the entire processor from scratch and use nothing from ARM or Intel except the instruction set specification, you still need to pay and it is not cheap. There are many situations where you want to avoid that cost. A researcher wants to experiment with a new idea, you want an internet of things processor but cannot afford the license cost of an existing processor. Or your Samsung and produce zillions of phones a year and saving that dollar per phone is worth having.<p>As the RISC-V standard is relatively new it means that the first designs to market are the targets that are easiest to create, so microcontrollers.

I recommend getting PCBs from Seeed studio in china - 10 PCBs starts at $20 (total) plus shipping (around $40). Throw in a solder stencil for another $20. When the stencil arrives use heavy scissors to cut out about two inches&#x2F;50mm around your design, take one of the pieces of stiff board that the PCBs are packaged with, tape down some extra PCBs around one free PCB, and then tape the stencil on the top so it lines up.<p>Get some solder paste from Digikey or Sparkfun and use an old gift card to squeegee it onto the PCB. Then lift the stencil up using one piece of tape as a hinge. Super easy to do this at home.<p>Now place on parts using tweezers and the microscope.<p>Then use the hot air gun to slowly heat up the PCB till it&#x27;s all about 260C, and then turn it to 360C and briefly melt the solder at all locations.

Right now GNOME shell is using around 100-200MiB (even more for several others) of memory on usual usage. I hope this could be reduced to some 50 MiB consistently, or even less.<p>Also GNOME shell strongly depends on evolution-data-server, gdm, tracker (I think), etc. It would be nice if these dependencies are made optional (ie, recommended, but not required packages). So that gnome shell can be run on less memory IOT systems like RPi, older laptops etc without the other dependencies. This may require changes to gnome shell in upstream GNOME.

We developed on HoloLens for a couple months. Working on the HoloLens app was actually my first foray into 3D development, and also required converting ThreeJS JSON into Unity models which was a mess.<p>The user experience\n--------------<p>HoloLens is mesmerizing. I&#x27;m not big into VR or anything, and will often make the arguement that VR hype will die out and is a fad. But there&#x27;s something very different about what Microsoft is doing. The ability to incorporate reality as a first class citizen in your 3D applications (or vice versa) is groundbreaking. People often complain about the FOV when they first try it out, and I had the same complaint, but your brain is able to compensate once it gets used to it, and then you stop noticing it. That&#x27;s something you don&#x27;t get from a short trial of it at a tech demo. The user inputs are indeed very clumsy still. We&#x27;ll need vast improvements in this area before HoloLens can feel immersive. But the amazing thing is that this first pass isn&#x27;t <i>that</i> bad. It can track your hands and it&#x27;s a computer that sits on your head. I mean, come on! I&#x27;m only 22 and even I think that&#x27;s amazing.<p>The developer experience\n------------------------<p>One of the major short comings of HoloLens development is its dependency on Unity. C# isn&#x27;t the problem. I love C# and use it daily now for web development. The problem is Unity uses .NET 2.0, and good luck finding C# libraries that are compatible. So for every new thing you want to do, you&#x27;re going to have to find a &quot;Unity compatible&quot; C# library, which is very annoying.<p>Unity will work for what you need most of the time, but it turns out if you want to try something custom (like your own gestures) then you&#x27;re out of luck, because the Unity APIs are limited in that way.<p>I suppose I&#x27;m mostly just not a fan of Unity&#x27;s component model. Constantly switching between adjusting settings in the IDE and coding feels like a bad way of developing.<p>Okay, so maybe you want to try something a little lower level. Microsoft offers a C++ API as well, and for the most part this is what you want if you need to harness the limited power of the HoloLens. I haven&#x27;t played around with all of the APIs, but I know of one in particular that left a bad taste in my mouth (this applies to Unity too) -- the spatial anchor API. For those of you who are unfamiliar, the spatial anchor API is the only way to acquire a durable and persistent reference to a real world location. This is done (I think) with sensor data (orientation, lighting, and images captured by the 4 on board spatial mapping cameras.) This is really an incredible feat of engineering, however it produces a binary which is around 15MB. Far too large to store in a database at scale. I&#x27;d like to see MS open up raw access to those sensors so middleware developers can try their hand at improving this aspect of HoloLens.<p>If C++ isn&#x27;t your thing, there&#x27;s a library called HoloJS. You guessed it, it&#x27;s a JS runtime for HoloLens with access to native libs. I actually started my own variation on this (called HolographicJS) before Microsoft released theirs, but I&#x27;m happy they&#x27;ve taken over.<p>The future\n----------<p>So what does this all mean for a device that seemly has its share of problems to overcome? Well, after trying it I&#x27;m fairly confident that MR as Microsoft calls it, is here to stay. The ability to mix reality with virtual reality, and augment that with a layer of environmental understanding is really incredible. I think we&#x27;re just scratching the surface of the possiblities.<p>HoloLens is the first in a new field of devices that I believe will come to replace all forms of computers we currently use: phones, laptops, desktops, tablets, etc. Even things like IOT devices. Why spend time building your own interfaces when you can just augment the users&#x27;?<p>If v2 had better FOV and improved input tracking, I&#x27;d consider it a major success. But if it also included improved spatial mapping and a reliable GPS, that could bring us into a whole new world, quite literally.<p>The way I see it, the first company to solve outdoor use of an MR device, and solve what I&#x27;m calling the &quot;universal spatial map&quot; problem, will run the world of tomorrow.<p>Imagine every machine being capable of interfacing with you without the need for a screen or separate device. Imagine walking down the street, gesturing to a restaurant and placing an order before you even get inside.<p>Further down the line.

People often fear what they don&#x27;t understand.<p>It is also why some people program in Haskell even if it is more complex than Python or Ruby on Rails.<p>I am talking about having an ARM CPU as a co-processor to an AMD or Intel system. You could even modify the X86 chips to have an ARM core or two because the design of the ARM chip is simpler than the Intel, which is why the Raspberry PI Zero is only $5 and is on a small circuit board powered by a USB cable.<p>The need for ARM code comes from mobile devices and in the Post-PC, Post-Microsoft, and Post-Windows era we need to look to alternatives to the way the PC used to work which was simple but out of date.<p>When JFK talked about going to the Moon, he didn&#x27;t say it because it would be simple, he said we should do it because it is hard or complex. When he said that he had no idea how the rocket would get to the Moon, etc.<p>I am talking about a PC&#x2F;Mobile hybrid using X86 and ARM technology that can run code made for both types of chips. One that both chips can work together as a team by assigning tasks to them.<p>Imagine if you will, Apple makes a new Hybrid Mac, it has an Intel CPU and ARM Co-Processor. It runs a new version of MacOS that has a virtual environment to run an ARM OS like iOS inside of it and has a touch screen. A developer can use XCode to create ARM iOS apps and then test them on the ARM chip which is the same in the latest iPhone&#x2F;iPad, etc.<p>Do you think MacOSX was simple or complex to design? It was based on Unix instead of writing from scratch. It is designed to only work on Apple branded PCs aka Macintoshes. If it were simple to design it would have met the same fate as Copeland and other failures like the Apple Lisa or Apple III. Instead, it took Unix which has a higher learning curve and put the Mac GUI on top of it to make it simpler.<p>Also, Linux do you think to hack the Linux kernel is simple or complex? Do you read all of the cussing Linus does when someone submits unstable code to it that they never tested? Do you know how hard that is, and to the user they know nothing about it and think it a simple thing?<p>Do you not know that electronics use math and formulas to work? Do you know that Algebra, Trigonometry, Geometry, Calculus I and II, and Differential Equations as well as Linear Algebra are also not simple but complex that students struggle to try and learn? What about Statistics as well as Finacial math? Not simple but complex. There is a lot of complexity done in computers and programs or apps or whatever you want to call it. To the user it appears simple to those of us who went to college and learned data processing aka information systems and computer science we know how complex a computer is. The Amiga was so good because not that it was simple or played video games, but it could emulate the Macintosh with AMax and eve if it has a slower 68000 than a real Mac the co-processors allowed it to run faster than a Mac with a faster chip in it. End users didn&#x27;t know how complex emulating a Monochrome PC DOS machine, or a Macintosh was, and only saw how easy it was to do so.<p>We are getting into the Mobile device age and the Internet of Things age and soon Qunatum computers and the Qubits that will change the way computers work and be more complicated than the X86 PCs or ARM based mobile devices are. The future belongs to the complex design that works better than the simple design.<p>This is the same mistake that most tech companies make, the people who can debug and write programs who are experts that write complex code, design complex computer systems, and make it so there are fewer bugs and fewer design flaws and save the company millions in expenses for  better quality control that needs less help desk hand holding support?<p>Do you ever notice when these people are fired or downsized that quality control suffers? That the OS and apps get bloated and slow, and suffer more bugs and flaws in it, even hackers stealing data like passwords and email addresses because someone didn&#x27;t sanitize code because management wanted it more simple than complex. That they hired 20something out of college or dropout people to replace the 30+ or 40+ year old experts for less money.<p>Sure you could say programmers are a dime a dozen, you get 500+ resumes a day for a programmer&#x27;s job? You go with the person willing to work for less money to cut costs, but the customer suffers.<p>Did you know why Apple has been more successful than Microsoft? Steve Jobs learned Six Sigma quality control to make Apple hardware and software a better quality than Microsoft&#x27;s. Microsoft got rid of the experts that made Windows stable or made a good mobile phone and Vista and Windows Powered devices were awful. Microsoft tried to deny it, but buying a Macintosh or iPhone was better than anything Microsoft put out because of quality control. Without Steve Jobs and his experts at Apple, Apple is starting to suffer as Microsoft had when quality was bad.<p>Google and Amazon had this problem but found a way to fix it by hiring better experts and quality control people.<p>So tell me did Evolution and Natural Selection makes a simple human brain or a complex one? It made a complex one that we have problems trying to figure it out how it works, while we try to copy it to an AI program as a series of nodes in a grid or matrix. If the human brain was so simple, we couldn&#x27;t even figure out how to make computers. Yet because it is complex it is a superior design.

I am not sure who came up with the five levels of self-driving car automation, but let me reiterate the last time before I give up trying to convince anyone on this thread.<p>First, for a computer to be able to navigate safely on the road the computer needs to be able to recongize and understand its surroundings. Checked.<p>Next, for computers to be able to be good at driving, we need to train the computer both in the real world and in simulations.<p>Moreover, to ensure we can optimize route, plan ahead we need data about road condition far ahead of us (and sometimes behind us). To be able to make turns on an intersection safely and swiftly, unlike humans who are terrible at making turns and confusing when to turn, computers can coordinate with one another. This requires good network communication. Bluetooth is weak and unstable. In my earlier example, if an ambulance says it is driving heading my direction, my car can coordinate how to empty up a lane for the ambluance to pass. This level of automation is what one sees in a sci-fi movie, which is really what you want besides being able to avoid obstacles like Bat mobile.<p>My point is, we should explore how to make traffic data accessible. There is so much one can do with such data. It takes a good amount of time to get the government onboard and help them build such infrastructure. To finish off my point, meter data is not available, right now apps use crowd source to determine whether a parking spot is available or not. Instead of driving around which causes\nmore congestion and sometimes accident, governement should make meter data available, and we can still crowd source by using driver&#x27;s camera to recongize whether a spot is opened and send back to datastore.<p>This is essentially the goal of Internet of Things, at rhe city scale.

Mechanisms to open and close windows. Dampers. Sensors for humidity, CO2, CO, temperature, rain, and fire.  Wired connections to everything.

Skylights overhead had openable windows on manual chain falls.  Outside windows overlooking the bay were openable. There were overhead fans and a standard HVAC system.\nNone of this was powered and controlled. So the place overheated and became uncomfortable with too many people inside.<p>In a space like that, as more people come in and the CO2 level goes up, the overhead windows and side windows should open and the overhead fans should go into reverse to bring down the CO2 level. Then the side windows should be adjusted to maintain temperature.  As evening comes and the outside temperature drops, the side windows should close more.  At some point, heat may be required.  As people start to leave, the CO2 level will drop, the overhead windows start to close and the fan speed drops. When everyone leaves, and the motion detectors see no movement, everything closes up and the temperature is allowed to drop to 60F or so for the night.<p>Some hotels have systems like that in function rooms. Any space with a widely variable people load, such as a classroom or conference room, should be equipped with CO2, humidity, and temperature sensors connected to actuators which can do something about it.", "parent": 14696618.0, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": null, "id": 14697441, "ranking": null, "date": 1499192691000, "year": 2017}, {"by": "HNtribal", "score": null, "time": 1499215871, "timestamp": 1499215871000, "title": "", "type": "comment", "url": "", "text": "TribalScale | Toronto, Canada | Orange County, California | Full time | Onsite | <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tribalscale.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tribalscale.com&#x2F;</a><p>TribalScale is a mobile first company that specializes in connected devices and the Internet of Things.

Because it is not relevant to the purpose of the diagram, while RiscOS is. Caricaturizing Windows is a premise of the diagram at a high level.

At least Y2K was easy for humans to understand, they all could see 1999 =&gt; 2000 and how that seemed important. I had bank CIO&#x27;s and large movie studio CIO&#x27;s calling me with &quot;unlimited budget to fix this&quot;. Because it was easy for their CEO and CFO to understand.<p>The challenge here will be that this seems awkward from a non-computer science standpoint. Have you tried to explain this to your Mom yet? It&#x27;s obvious to bit heads but not regular humans. Even my own very technical team thought I was a bit off my rocker talking about this in 1999.<p>The other very real challenge is the generation gap, many devs working on stuff today have no experience with Y2K issues, they just haven&#x27;t been working on systems long enough to be bitten by that stuff. They look at old code where some &quot;if (yy &lt; 69)&quot; hack was put in place to support old YYMMDD formats and wonder what the crazy dev was thinking when they pushed that code.<p>On top of all these issues we have IOT being deployed by brilliant young minds who have no experience dealing with things that have to work for 50 years plus. If anything, the IOT ecosystem is moving to a &quot;technology consumer&quot; mentality where things are built to barely survive 18 months and everyone is moving so quickly they don&#x27;t worry about 2038 because &quot;it&#x27;s eons from now&quot;. Most of these companies won\u2019t be in business in 2038 but their products will litter the world and still be plugged in bashing away at whatever the internet is by then.<p>The velocity of this decade is amazing, I stand in awe as I watch all the new technologies that get cranked out in rapid succession.  However much of that has been due to the &quot;fail fast, iterate rapidly&quot; approach. Which is great in many ways, but formal verification has taken a back seat while most teams have no engineering review team. These things slowed us down in the past and we have rightfully tossed them over our shoulders in the ever rapidly accelerating pursuit of innovation. However, we have lost of a lot of what it really means to be an \u201cengineer\u201d along the way.<p>Hacking is great, until it gets someone killed. Thus far software has eaten most of the world that doesn\u2019t kill people. Now we tread into the world that will, the physical world, self-driving trucks, trains, planes, automobiles. Coffee makers that boil over and burn a four-year-old kid who just thought it was fun to push the red thing on dad\u2019s tablet. This is the world we are headed into, and the 2038 problem is really just the tip of the iceberg.<p>I can tell you the Y2K problem was real, it was painful but easier for humans to understand. If we want companies to prioritize resources to fix 2038 problems now over the next shiny button they want in their UI we will need a massive marketing campaign to get people to understand. Because in the end devs don\u2019t make all the decisions on resource allocation and the people who do have no clue how things really work. It\u2019s an age-old tension between the technologists and the business leaders. How we overcome that here is unclear to me, but I think the basic issue is getting people to understand the potential impact so it comes up in conversations in the Board Room and the CEO is asking the CIO&#x2F;CTO \u201cSo what are we doing about 2038?\u201d.

Even the Fortune 150 I work for has now outsourced its email and messaging, from in-house Notes, to hosted Office365. That represents HUNDREDS of internal admins that are simply no longer needed in one of the largest manufacturers in the country. Even someone with experience and specialized knowledge in basic networking and services (email&#x2F;file &amp; print&#x2F;DNS&#x2F;DHCP) will have a hard time finding &quot;gigs&quot; going forward with Google Apps and Office365 in the market.

A kid who grew up with a smartphone is all you need to set it up.<p>We, as a society, are already leveraging the efforts of a relative tiny few to alleviate the work of thousands, even hundreds of thousands, just in IT services, and this grows exponentially by the year.

All entertainment being copyrighted by 4 companies. All IT being controlled by about 6. All cell services in the hands of (essentially) 2. All broadband in 4. On and on it goes.

The result is an IOT device that is cheap, readily available, and fully under your own control with no hardware modifications necessary!<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mirko&#x2F;SonOTA\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mirko&#x2F;SonOTA</a>", "parent": 15778262.0, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": null, "id": 15778569, "ranking": null, "date": 1511652544000, "year": 2017}, {"by": "rayparker", "score": 1.0, "time": 1511867516, "timestamp": 1511867516000, "title": "Internet of Things in Retail: What\u2019s in It for Retailers \u2013 ReadWrite", "type": "story", "url": "https://readwrite.com/2017/11/24/internet-of-things-plus-retail/", "text": "", "parent": null, "deleted": null, "dead": true, "descendants": null, "id": 15796147, "ranking": null, "date": 1511867516000, "year": 2017}, {"by": "tech_hunt", "score": 1.0, "time": 1511868935, "timestamp": 1511868935000, "title": "From the INTERNET OF THINGS to the INTELLIGENCE OF THINGS", "type": "story", "url": "https://cio-elite.cioreviewindia.com/cxoinsight/from-the-internet-of-things-to-the-intelligence-of-things--nid-3636-cid-138.html", "text": "", "parent": null, "deleted": null, "dead": true, "descendants": null, "id": 15796251, "ranking": null, "date": 1511868935000, "year": 2017}, {"by": "fixermark", "score": null, "time": 1511883873, "timestamp": 1511883873000, "title": "", "type": "comment", "url": "", "text": "How does DMCA 1201 undermine the formation of a market for video transmission and the Internet of Things based around open and auditable standards?", "parent": 15795808.0, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": null, "id": 15798215, "ranking": null, "date": 1511883873000, "year": 2017}, {"by": "edent", "score": 2.0, "time": 1511889688, "timestamp": 1511889688000, "title": "There's No HTTPS for the Internet of Things", "type": "story", "url": "https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2017/11/theres-no-https-for-the-internet-of-things/", "text": "", "parent": null, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": 0.0, "id": 15799236, "ranking": null, "date": 1511889688000, "year": 2017}, {"by": "tech_hunt", "score": 1.0, "time": 1511956029, "timestamp": 1511956029000, "title": "How the Internet of Things Is Changing the Approach to Technology and Business", "type": "story", "url": "https://embedded-technology.cioreviewindia.com/cioviewpoint/how-the-internet-of-things-is-changing-the-approach-to-technology-and-business-nid-2567-cid-98.html", "text": "", "parent": null, "deleted": null, "dead": true, "descendants": null, "id": 15806107, "ranking": null, "date": 1511956029000, "year": 2017}, {"by": "jamiesonbecker", "score": null, "time": 1511968003, "timestamp": 1511968003000, "title": "", "type": "comment", "url": "", "text": "Additional details:<p>You have to log into jumpbox (presumably still running on port 22) in order to log into the device who&#x27;s SSH listening port has been forwarded from port 22 on the device itself across the encrypted tunnel to port 22001 on the localhost of the jumpbox.<p>If instead you prefer to expose the 22001 to the entire world (so you don&#x27;t need to log into the jumpbox first), try this:<p><pre><code>    device$  ssh jumpbox -R 22001:*:22\n</code></pre>\nThen, to log into the device, you can just<p><pre><code>    laptop$  ssh jumpbox -p 22001\n</code></pre>\nwhich will pass your encrypted packets securely through from your laptop to the end device (and the jumpbox can NOT see them.)<p>Keep in mind that, with this method, any potential attacker can now directly try to break into the device itself <i>through the jumpbox</i> rather than have to break into the jumpbox first, so make sure that you harden both the jumpbox and the end device (which is always a good idea anyway - don&#x27;t deploy an IOT device that isn&#x27;t hardened!)", "parent": 15789489.0, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": null, "id": 15807292, "ranking": null, "date": 1511968003000, "year": 2017}, {"by": "martinezm", "score": 1.0, "time": 1511976065, "timestamp": 1511976065000, "title": "Contextualised Service Delivery in the Internet of Things: Parking Recommender [pdf]", "type": "story", "url": "https://www.computer.org/cms/Computer.org/ComputingNow/issues/2017/11/07845479.pdf", "text": "", "parent": null, "deleted": null, "dead": true, "descendants": null, "id": 15808686, "ranking": null, "date": 1511976065000, "year": 2017}, {"by": "notatoad", "score": null, "time": 1512013221, "timestamp": 1512013221000, "title": "", "type": "comment", "url": "", "text": "Why do internet of things devices have to connect to the internet?

But okay, here goes:<p>1. The post assumes that the search result quality is not good. This simply is not the case. Users say the search results are good. Could they be better? Sure. Are they terrible? No.<p>2. The post assumes users want transparency on the search algorithm. This clearly is not the case. The whole reason that google became what it is today is because of the lack of clutter and good search results.<p>If you remember Altavista then you remember users constantly having to fidget with all these knobs in the advanced section to get relevant search results. Lycos, excite, etc weren&#x27;t much better. I remember using Google for the first time and it just worked.<p>3. The post assumes that users want deep customization. This again is not the case. Users want less clutter, less knobs, and a faster search experience. Google is delivering that.<p>4. The post assumes that any startup with a better algorithm can beat google. However this is not the case. Google has deep search integration with mobile providers such as it&#x27;s own Android OS and also iOS. it also has it&#x27;s own browser (Chrome) and has paid deals with Mozilla. Obviously, both browsers default to Google when you type something in the search field.<p>Not to mention, the leading IOT devices all connect to Google to find results when it needs to search the web. And for safe measure, Google has come out with its own voice assistant device, Google home, to safe guard against any shenanigans from Apple&#x27;s Siri and Amazon&#x27;s Alexa that might happen in the future. It is heavily subsidizing the price to make sure it has a strong horse in the voice game.<p>Integration aside, it also has scale. It crawls most of the internet several times a day. That&#x27;s no small feat and it is quite hard for a startup to just replicate that with funding. I mean, even that won&#x27;t cut it.<p>Google is now even using machine learning to understand relevant pieces of information on a webpage so when you query it by typing on your keyboard, by voice, or future mind control it delivers the answer you were looking for.<p>The only valid point the post makes is that Google has squashed competition by buying any startup that remotely could threaten it&#x27;s position...for safe measure.

And while that flaw has now been patched, \n  we certainly disagree with reporter Michael Orcutt\u2019s \n  assertion that IOTA is \u201csecure.\u201d As the Director of the \n  MIT Media Lab, I felt it important we outline our specific \n  concerns. \n\n\n  \u2014 Joi*\n\n</code></pre>\nQuote One:<p><pre><code>  \u201cThe rally began in late November, after the IOTA \n  Foundation, the German nonprofit behind the novel \n  cryptocurrency, announced that it was teaming up with \n  several major technology firms to develop a \u2018decentralized \n  data marketplace.\u2019\u201d The article goes on to say: \u201cAnd the \n  high-profile names participating in its data market pilot\u2014\n  including Microsoft, Deutsche Telekom, and Fujitsu\u2014suggest \n  IOTA is onto something.\u201d\n\n</code></pre>\nResponse One:<p><pre><code>  IOTA\u2019s relationships with top-tier companies continue to \n  be nebulous.\n\n\n  In the Technology Review article, Orcutt linked to a \n  November 28, 2017 blog post from IOTA that gave the \n  perception that Microsoft was a partner in the \n  marketplace. However, after a flurry of media reports \n  making this claim, IOTA corrected their relationship \n  status with top-tier companies like Microsoft, Cisco, and \n  Huawei in a blog post dated December 16. That the MIT Tech \n  Review story links to IOTA\u2019s initial blog post instead of \n  the later version is misleading.\n\n</code></pre>\nQuote Two:<p><pre><code>  Though IOTA tokens can be used like any other \n  cryptocurrency, the protocol was designed specifically for \n  use on connected devices, says cofounder David S\u00f8nsteb\u00f8. \n  Organizations collect huge amounts of data from these \n  gadgets, from weather tracking systems to sensors that \n  monitor the performance of industrial machinery (a.k.a. \n  the Internet of things). But nearly all of that \n  information is wasted, sitting in siloed databases and not \n  making money for its owners, says S\u00f8nsteb\u00f8.\n\n\n  IOTA\u2019s system can address this in two ways, he says. \n  First, it can assure the integrity of this data by \n  securing it in a tamper-proof decentralized ledger.\n\n\n</code></pre>\nResponse Two:<p><pre><code>  Whether or not IOTA\u2019s ledger is \u201ctamper-proof,\u201d the entire \n  IOTA network went down in November, and was completely \n  inoperable for about three days. That this has never \n  happened in Bitcoin or Ethereum suggests the extent to \n  which the IOTA network relies on the \u201ccoordinator\u201d\u2014a \n  single point of failure\u2014and is not truly decentralized.\n\n\n  Also troubling, IOTA developers were able to transfer \n  funds out of users\u2019 IOTA accounts. The user was then \n  required to participate in a \u201creclaim\u201d process to request \n  their funds. We believe IOTA\u2019s developers should not have \n  access to such funds; it\u2019s rife with risk.\n\n</code></pre>\nQuote Three:<p><pre><code>  Second, it enables fee-less transactions between the \n  owners of the data and anyone who wants to buy it\u2014and \n  there are plenty of companies that want to get their hands \n  on data.\n\n\n  Now, here\u2019s where things get really interesting. Instead \n  of a blockchain, IOTA uses a \u201ctangle,\u201d which is based on a \n  mathematical concept called a directed acyclic graph. \n  S\u00f8nsteb\u00f8 says his team pursued an alternative approach \n  after deciding that blockchains are too costly\u2014it has \n  recently cost as much as $20 per Bitcoin transaction \n  because of high demand\u2014and inefficient to operate at the \n  scale required for the Internet of things.\n\n</code></pre>\nResponse Three:<p><pre><code>  Orcutt\u2019s claim that IOTA is free of fees is misleading. \n  Though perhaps not immediately obvious, IOTA transactions \n  are &quot;zero fee&quot; in exactly the same way that Bitcoin \n  transactions are. An important difference is that Bitcoin \n  has miners who can perform the proof of work for you, \n  while IOTA users do the proof of work on their own \n  devices, per transaction. However, a Bitcoin user can also \n  mine their own block to get their transactions accepted \n  into the blockchain without paying fees. To put it another \n  way, most people wouldn\u2019t be interested in buying a \n  refrigerator operated by a hand crank, even if the \n  advertisement said \u201cNo electricity required!\u201d\n\n\n  It\u2019s true that transactions with Bitcoin and other digital \n  currencies, even when amortized over a block with \n  thousands of other transactions, require much more work \n  than transactions in IOTA. However, the claim is not that \n  IOTA transactions are easier\u2014the claim appears to be that \n  IOTA transactions are free.\n\n\n  Semantics aside, this claim, which appears in IOTA \n  marketing materials, is deceptive; the work required is a \n  fee, whether or not it requires a monetary payment. \n  Restricting the ways in which the fee can be \n  paid\u2014requiring that the work be done on a user\u2019s own \n  device\u2014doesn\u2019t make it go away.\n\n</code></pre>\nQuote Four:<p><pre><code>  \u201cIn August, researchers from MIT and Boston University \n  reported that they discovered a \u201cserious vulnerability\u201d in \n  a novel cryptographic technique IOTA was using. IOTA has \n  patched the vulnerability, and S\u00f8nsteb\u00f8 says that security \n  measures in place would have prevented anyone from losing \n  funds. The foundation has hired a third-party firm to help \n  it continue to develop the technique, which S\u00f8nsteb\u00f8 says \n  represents the kind of \u201clightweight cryptography\u201d needed \n  for low-power connected devices, like sensors.\u201d\n\n</code></pre>\nResponse Four:<p><pre><code>  Once the Digital Currency Initiative published the break \n  in IOTA\u2019s curl hash function, its author, Sergey \n  Ivancheglo, offered two conflicting explanations for the \n  vulnerability.\n\n\n  The first explanation was that the flaw was \n  intentional\u2014that it was meant to serve as a form of \u201ccopy \n  protection.\u201d If anyone used this code in their own work, \n  he said, the IOTA developers would be able to exploit the \n  flaw and damage other systems that were using the hash \n  function. However, later, he offered a conflicting \n  explanation that he didn\u2019t write the curl at all, but that\n   an AI wrote it.\n\n\n  We do not find either of these explanations convincing, \n  even in isolation. That they contradict each other makes \n  them even less so.</code></pre>", "parent": 16257029.0, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": null, "id": 16257072, "ranking": null, "date": 1517228970000, "year": 2018}, {"by": "empath75", "score": null, "time": 1517233370, "timestamp": 1517233370000, "title": "", "type": "comment", "url": "", "text": "Blockchain + IOT = enough buzzwords to profit off of the greater fool theory.", "parent": 16257316.0, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": null, "id": 16257406, "ranking": null, "date": 1517233370000, "year": 2018}, {"by": "raitucarp", "score": null, "time": 1517235218, "timestamp": 1517235218000, "title": "", "type": "comment", "url": "", "text": "I just copy paste from CfB&#x27;s response, in case you missed it:<p>Thank you. This article was useful for me, it showed what details of IOTA haven\u2019t been highlighted yet.

A swarm can process more transactions than a single full node.<p>\u201cThis means, if you run a full IOTA node, anyone on the IOTA network can write data to your hard drive with just a small, extremely low cost proof-of-work.\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aIOTA was created for the Internet-of-Things with network-bound PoW in mind, the current state of things is temporary.<p>\u201cOver time, the IOTA transaction set size can grow unbounded, leaving only storage farms with the resources required to host the data.\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aThis is incorrect even for Bitcoin because of pruning techniques.<p>\u201cMy past experience working at companies that develop hardware products tells me this does not make sense in any other way but a marketing bullet.\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aWhile this thing is likely correct I decided to list it here. IOTA team has experience working at companies developing hardware products too. Even more, I bet your smartphone contains a chip developed by one of our advisors.<p>\u201cIOTA claims their Ternary-based Proof-of-Work function will work with IOT because it uses minimal power, but I contend that any power usage more significant than signing a transaction is too much because there is another alternative approach.\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aAs I already said, IOTA will be using network-bound PoW, which will be consuming less energy than required for a transaction signing.<p>\u201cContacting a central server run by the company that built the IOT device, announcing the need to submit a transaction at which point the centralized server will submit the transaction on the device\u2019s behalf.\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aYou described the Internet, not the IoT.

(The real-virtual mapping problem)<p>In the pharma industry for example you have hundreds of manufacturers and thousands of wholesalers and tens of thousands of pharmacies, thousands of carriers, thousands of re-packers, thousands of customs brokers, hundreds of freight forwarders and 3PLs etc.<p>Furthermore, unlike Diamonds, it is not a simple linear flow of serialized items. Many items are actually lot-tracked and not serial-tracked. So, now you have the notion of splitting of lots and blending and combining of lots. Additionally items will go back and forth between distributors.<p>Additionally, you have IOT readings along the entire provenance history like temperature, humidity, location etc.<p>When an entity receives a serial or lot tracked item they can trace its provenance on the blockchain and decide whether and to what <i>degree</i> they want to trust whether what the previous entities wrote to the blockchain needed to be second guessed.<p>Often when receiving, entities will perform some sort of QA. The degree of QA will be dictated by who, what, when and where the item went through in its entire journey.<p>If they have high trust in the entities in the chain of custody they may only do partial check (eg. check for no broken seals), but if they don&#x27;t trust the entities in the chain they may do a full assay of a sample or they may take the middle ground and do a quick spectrophotometry analysis. With any of these results they can write <i>their</i> certification to the blockchain so that <i>subsequent</i> entities may not have to re-certify if they trust <i>this</i> intermediate entity.<p>So, one way to think about this is that chain-of-custody is not all or nothing, but rather based on degrees of trust. Also every participant views the situation differently based on whom they trust.<p>Now back to the original question of whether this could be done with a central database instead of blockchain. The answer is &quot;of course&quot;, but now even the <i>who</i> and the <i>what</i> is potentially suspect IN ADDITION to the virtual-physical mapping problem.<p>Blockchain-based chain-of-custody solutions allows one to design a system focused only on mitigating the real-virtual mapping problem.", "parent": 16256728.0, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": null, "id": 16258220, "ranking": null, "date": 1517241774000, "year": 2018}, {"by": "PinguTS", "score": null, "time": 1517243285, "timestamp": 1517243285000, "title": "", "type": "comment", "url": "", "text": "Such devices are using ARM Cortex M0, M1, or M3 processors.

What you&#x27;re getting for $49 is hopefully a stable, tested, and well-supported platform which can really help when all you want to do (or can afford to do) is concentrate on the other aspects of your product.  Built-in OTA upgrades and pre-built manufacturing tools are very helpful as well.  The $49 price point however, assuming a retail product, probably puts your final retail price north of $100 by the time you add in all the other components you&#x27;re going to need to make this work plus profit.  If your product fits into that space then you could save a lot of time going with a solution like this (but I do see a cost-reduction round in your near future).<p>If you&#x27;re trying to stay below the magic $99 retail price point though, you may be in for a challenge.  Do you need a battery?  Is that chip antenna good enough or do you need to have a better one made?  Plastics?  Power supply?  Those DF40-80 connectors alone are going to account for north of $1 in manufacturing quantities.

I want a machine that can be declared and rebuilt deterministically (at least semi-deterministically, rolling distro and all). I looked into NixOS, but the DSL was too much, and the npm&#x2F;pip&#x2F;etc stuff was a mess. I am a fan of Arch because of it&#x27;s package availability and documentation, so I figured out a way to combine the two, using a &quot;Docker-ish&quot; approach.<p>My entire machines are built on Travis-CI and pushed to Docker Hub. Once I make a change to my recipes, ~20 minutes later, I can pull a fresh image and boot again.<p>Another thing I didn&#x27;t like with non-declarative OSs (non-NixOS) was that if I wanted to just test a package out, after removing it, it would leave shards of config&#x2F;package dependencies still on my system. With Darch, each boot has a tmpfs overlay, which means I can uninstall&#x2F;install to my heart&#x27;s desire, knowing that only things I commit to my recipes will be persisted. For example, I was trying to setup Ruby, and I had to try many ruby environment managers before I found one I liked. After a reboot, I was certain that the other ruby packages I tried where 100% scrubbed from my machine.<p>I also like the Docker approach, because using layers, I can quickly switch our the &quot;desktop environment&quot; layer to i3&#x2F;plasma&#x2F;gnome&#x2F;etc, or my base image from Ubuntu&#x2F;Arch&#x2F;VoidLinux. This makes distro and DE hoping a breeze.<p>As for using Darch as a server, I would wait until I get the Ubuntu image done. That way, the builds will be more deterministic (instead of using rolling distros). I can see using that for servers, or IOT devices. I also intend to add PXE support to boot these images from the network, making it easy to manage the operating system on a fleet of devices.

Some users might have the expectation that it does work.<p>On the more expensive devices, while I have a limited sample, my short career in IOT security has shown me that your $100-$300 devices have pretty serious security implications.<p>And I think there are a couple reasons why this is the case:<p>Atleast some (most?) of these products are being built by average developers with average exposure to security, so like other areas of tech, should be just as vulnerable as everything else.<p>IOT is a young industry, so you don&#x27;t have the same set of best practices and common code that you can leverage. Ever wanted to encrypt sensor data, on a cpu that&#x27;s designed to operate for a year on a coin battery? Turns out you can&#x27;t just run openssl and TLS to secure that low power wireless connection. And that sensor might be the one telling you&#x27;re security system to trigger.<p>Hardware is a super competitive market, so when it turns out you&#x27;re basically selling every unit at a loss to try and gain market share, it doesn&#x27;t leave a huge amount of room to invest in security best practices vs. get it done and shipped. You know that wireless sensor that detects when you&#x27;re home and changes you&#x27;re settings, well it&#x27;s basically broadcasting to the neighbourhood whether you&#x27;re home or not. It&#x27;s a theoretical problem (every problem is until it isn&#x27;t), that someone could use that against you, so do we worry about that, or do we worry about optimizing our code so that the battery doesn&#x27;t have to be changed every month.<p>Please keep in mind, I have limited exposure, but in my experience working on this, I think unless companies can prove they&#x27;re actively investing in security (and not just saying they care about security), we should be suspicious. I can see why the industry as a whole could be failing to protect it&#x27;s consumers, and probably deserves a poor reputation for security.<p>And because you don&#x27;t hear some researcher talking about product x, doesn&#x27;t mean that product doesn&#x27;t have abysmal security.

Can&#x27;t say.  AI predictions have been notoriously bad.  (Usually overconfident, but also in the other direction.  20 years ago it was obvious computers would be able to beat any grandmaster in chess sometime in our lives, but go was considered to be something dramatically past that.<p>So I don&#x27;t know if it will happen or even be able to happen.

Cryptome is run by the architects Deborah Natsios and John Young, who live and work in New York City (any use of the first person is from Natsios&#x27; perspective). Part one, which you can read here, delves into their backgrounds and motivations. Part two deals more with their views on the contemporary city and the politics of information access.<p>I was hoping you could draw something like a sketch of the city as you see it today, perhaps using New York, where you both live and work, as an example. How does surveillance operate in the city? How does information become a mechanism of control? I&#x27;m thinking a bit about your recent postings on Twitter of surreptitious surveillance cameras.<p>Our place of work overlooks a long stretch of historic Broadway, the city&#x27;s oldest north-south thoroughfare and a former native trail. Broadway charts a diagonal exception to the Commissioners&#x27; Plan of 1811, which famously overlaid a rectangular grid as a rationalizing technique to discipline wild Manhattan&#x27;s island topography.Vibrant democracy has to make public space available for the unexpected, the creative, the dissenting without fear of reprisal<p>Broadway&#x27;s everyday percussion of taxis, fire engines, ambulance sirens, garbage trucks, barking dogs and toddler tantrums that reach our windows confirms that, in spite of the grid, eruptions of near-chaos have always been part of the creative hardscape. It&#x27;s only when we join the anarchic materiality of street-level democracy as autonomous, anonymous or social pedestrians that we feel truly embodied in the living city. Vibrant democracy has to make public space available for the unexpected, the creative, the dissenting without fear of reprisal.<p>Not visible from our upper aerie is the concealed architectonic of municipal grids superimposed in recent decades onto legacy disciplines of 1811. We cannot see vast information infrastructures that encode processes of worldwide economic restructuring whose capital, symbols, goods and bodies flow through the local interests of our relentlessly global city. Harnessing informational flows falls under the trending rubric of municipal &#x27;smart&#x27; policies.<p>Metropolitan governance has widely embraced market-driven best practices derived from global risk management approaches, as David Lyon notes. Their privatizing regimes are anticipating and controlling urban outcomes through risk calculations that mine big data from myriad sources. Most provocative are analytics gleaned from ubiquitous watching and tracking of bodies that make up the city&#x27;s far-flung, mobile and diasporic populations. We are increasingly visible to invisible regimes. Cryptome&#x27;s library for information equality works in small, daily increments to invert this diagram.We are increasingly visible to invisible regimes.<p>As part of modest efforts to do our part to help shore up the diminishing public domain, Cryptome has been documenting in recent weeks the block-by-block smart upgrading of New York City&#x27;s obsolete public telephony system. Trenches are being chopped along the street, rope pulled through underground innerduct, rebar placed to receive poured concrete, galvanized steel pedestals positioned with orange power cable and fiber poking out of conduit.<p>Credit: Cryptome\t\nCredit: Cryptome<p>Installed onto the legacy footprint of the city&#x27;s former sidewalk payphone system, 7,500 to 10,000 &#x27;Structures&#x27; of the dispersed LinkNYC system will broadcast &#x27;relevant&#x27; ads on 55\u201d HD screens to subsidize the kiosks&#x27; free gigabit-speed Internet service, free public wi-fi, free domestic phone calls, free USB phone-charging outlets and a 911 emergency call button.<p>Assemblages like these undergird smart cities that are consolidating around us, with boosterish zeal, for the supposed benefit of municipal efficiency, convenience and social equity. Big data collection technologies that enable the Internet of Things (IoT) are embedding into larger scale urban infrastructures towards that end.<p>But can smart space be democratic public space when speech and acts are ubiquitously recorded and reported? Are apps &#x27;free&#x27; when they harvest vast troves of personal data without consent? can smart space be democratic public space when speech and acts are ubiquitously recorded and reported?Wi-fi hotspots are notoriously insecure. Smartphones exude communications trails and geolocational clues. LinkNYC&#x27;s multiple onboard sensors include microphones and concealed pinhole cameras that capture ambient data for 24&#x2F;7 delivery to downstream analytics.<p>Surveillant practices capture and process our digital traces as abstracted New Yorkers, fragmenting personal data into simulated identities stored in various databases or resold to data brokers. Jury pool lists, marriage licenses, voting records, civil disobedience misdemeanors, rifle permits and police dossiers\u2013\u2013analog bureaucratic records that constituted an earlier idea of civic modernity\u2013\u2013are now logged electronically. They coordinate with other databases, both commercial and municipal, through powerful data-mining analytics that reinforce the social partitions and economic divisions of the inequitably stratified city, as Lyon warns.<p>During the 1960s, Jane Jacobs advocated &#x27;eyes on the street&#x27; as a citizen-directed management of public space that invited watchful caring of neighbors and strangers. New Yorkers could make 911 calls seeking emergency assistance from the analog payphone system first installed in the 1920s.<p>Credit: Cryptome\t\nCredit: Cryptome<p>After 9&#x2F;11, the NYPD deputized New Yorkers as para-policing informants, urging them to act on fear and suspicion: &#x27;if you see something say something&#x27;. The vintage payphone system had fallen into disuse. Post-9&#x2F;11 visualization and reporting regimes revealed risk management-style policing coordinating with command-and-control technologies developed for military battlespace and cyberwar. Preemptive war-gaming targeted Muslim neighborhoods of Bay Ridge, Pakistani communities along Coney Island Avenue, public housing in the South Bronx and Bangladeshi enclaves in Kensington.<p>A company that produces military mission control systems manufactures LinkNYC kiosks through a spin off entity. Installed along public sidewalks at a granular coverage of every 200 feet or so, the devices introduce an unprecedented urban apparatus: the coordinated automation and privatization of neighborhood-scale sensing and reporting derived from military command-and-control technology.

There are also fitness trackers which record all the data for us that, previously, we would have had to measure and jot down manually (which is why we didn&#x27;t), and messengers like WhatsApp which allow us to get in touch with anyone at any time. (Anyone remember how the contacts we had in AIM&#x2F;YIM&#x2F;ICQ&#x2F;MSN messenger used to be online only when they were at their computer? How annoying it used to be to exchange files and photos with friends?) We even have personal assistants now which remind us of upcoming events, notify us about traffic jams on our way to work and allow us to communicate with our devices through speech and thus in a more natural way. Finally, don&#x27;t forget news feeds and content aggregators like Facebook, Instagram and Google News which make it so effortless to consume content that, for many users, they have basically become the only portal to the internet and any content outside these platforms is basically invisible unless some post on, say, Facebook links to it. Which, in turn, implies that providers outside these platforms necessarily have to somehow pick up their users on these platforms and bring them to theirs. (Remember how it used to be the other way around? But how many people really still type in URLs in their browser&#x27;s address bar these days? How annoying and inconvenient!)<p>At the same time, almost all platforms that have risen over the past ten years are those whose value proposition is precisely this: Convenience. One could even say that the reason today&#x27;s internet is an internet of monopolies and big walled gardens is that it&#x27;s more convenient. Even the internet of things basically is&#x2F;will be nothing else than added convenience (at least when it comes to private consumers).<p>On the other hand, the reason that privacy and security concerns don&#x27;t matter to the vast majority of internet users is that they are not only not convenient\u2014they are the exact opposite. The same thing goes for the algorithms that tell us what to consume. Even if they all were open-source, who would really take the time to understand how they work?<p>Call me a pessimist but I predict that this trend will prevail. Every consumer-oriented Next Big Thing\u00ae will make our lives even easier. At the same time, we will continue to lose control over our data and over what we consume as algorithms dictate our interests.<p>Remember how the internet of the 2000s used to be this promised land where, to us techies, anything seemed to be possible?

For example, my bank account file I am querying shows how I&#x27;m spending my moneys. It looks like below and I have few more advanced queries doing some different calculations on my CSV file.<p>select \n\tExtractFromDate(DataOperacji, &#x27;month&#x27;) as &#x27;Month&#x27;,\n\tExtractFromDate(DataOperacji, &#x27;year&#x27;) as &#x27;Year&#x27;,\n\tSumIncome(ToDecimal(Kwota, &#x27;pl-PL&#x27;)) as &#x27;Income&#x27;,\n\tSumOutcome(ToDecimal(Kwota, &#x27;pl-PL&#x27;)) as &#x27;Outcome&#x27;,\n\tSumIncome(ToDecimal(Kwota, &#x27;pl-PL&#x27;)) - Abs(SumOutcome(ToDecimal(Kwota, &#x27;pl-PL&#x27;))) as &#x27;Total&#x27;\nfrom #csv.file(&#x27;C:\\some\\path\\my_account.csv&#x27;, &#x27;;&#x27;, true, 37)\ngroup by \n\tExtractFromDate(DataOperacji, &#x27;month&#x27;),\n\tExtractFromDate(DataOperacji, &#x27;year&#x27;)<p>from another point of usage, I&#x27;m sometimes using it to find files in folders as I can both query file properties and their content. Also, I was testing it with querying git repository (I was using <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;libgit2&#x2F;libgit2sharp\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;libgit2&#x2F;libgit2sharp</a>), If you are curious about some statistics, then probably it would be usable for you.<p>Another thing I would imagine is that when you have such a huge compressed file that you can&#x27;t unpack, then you could query such a file and unpack only what you needs. It doesn&#x27;t have to be a packed file only. It can be such a big log file that most of editors wouldn&#x27;t be able to open.<p>Another thing, If you are an administrator and have to move buch of files or create yourself a view how the files looks in more aggregated way, then it will be probably good for you (I&#x27;m not an administrator and never was so please take into consideration that my point of view may be clearly wrong)<p>Different thing, If you&#x27;ve got a bunch of IOT devices, you would end up writing plugin that gets data from such devices and provides you rich statistics about various things.<p>Another possibility, you need event (for scheduling purposes) that fits some sophisticated time pattern, you can&#x27;t use CRON becouse it&#x27;s syntax has some serious limitations, probably it will be better to query time for such a pattern and store it somewhere. Otherwise you would need writing a lot of single CRON expressions that all fits your requirements.<p>I will go right now into some crazy imaginations like:<p>You would end up writing a plugin that extract some statistics from photos (like is the image contains people, how many of them are, what are the color of sky, does it has sun?) and then query some huge photo sets about how many of images contains people and also have a sky as a background). \nIt should be really fast as your plugin can use some C++ library to fastly process images.

He chalks up the abysmal security record of IoT devices to two factors: it keeps IoT devices cheap, and IoT vendors don&#x27;t understand history. And there&#x27;s a lot of truth in both these assertions! But they are both just expressing facets of a deeper, more fundamental reason: IoT devices aren&#x27;t secure because <i>their customers don&#x27;t demand security.</i><p>This deeper problem completely explains why the two higher-level problems he observes exist. Making your product secure makes it more expensive and slower to come to market than just leaving it wide open, and the IoT vendors know their customers care about cost and availability and don&#x27;t care about security. So they do the rational (in the <i>homo economicus</i> sense of the term) thing and optimize for things their customers are actually willing to pay for.<p>The same causality can be observed in the ML world. Mickens asks why people are hooking ML systems whose operation isn&#x27;t fully understood to important things like financial decisionmaking and criminal justice systems. The answer is that <i>the customers demand it.</i> ML is trendy and buzzworthy, so if you&#x27;re a vendor of (say) financial systems, and you can find some way to incorporate ML into your offerings with a straight face, now you have an attractive new checkbox on the feature list your salespeople dangle in front of potential customers. And once the effectiveness of having that box checked becomes clear, you kind of <i>have</i> to do it, even if you know it&#x27;ll be ineffective or even worse, or risk losing business to a competitor with fewer scruples.<p>All of which is to say that what we see playing out in both these scenarios isn&#x27;t really the vendors&#x27; fault. They are instead classic examples of market failure. People end up buying shoddy products because spotting their shoddiness requires technical expertise they don&#x27;t have; responsible vendors who try not to make shoddy products lose sales to irresponsible vendors who don&#x27;t; eventually all the responsible vendors are out of business and the only products available to buy are shoddy ones.

A lot of IOT devices support multiple IOT platforms, for example the Philips Hue supports IFTTT, Google Home, Amazon, and of course HomeKit, but the first three options only allow your IOT devices to work in your home with <i>permanent wide area</i> network access. Latency issues aside, this is bad for security because it simply opens more attack vectors to your devices, and relies on third parties to manage your security. What&#x27;s the benefit of relying on Amazon to manage your IOT devices? Well for the average Joe, it means he won&#x27;t have to buy a home &quot;hub&quot; (Apple TV&#x2F;iPad) for allowing remote access of some sort, and also the setup process is generally easier. Problems arise because the IOT device is now responsible for accessing the Internet, and has to contain a much larger codebase.<p>HomeKit&#x27;s design is that each IOT device will talk to your local devices, i.e. an iPhone, an iPad, an Apple TV. If and only if you set up an iDevice as a home &quot;hub&quot;, do you allow remote access. HomeKit is keeping it modular, which means that if a serious bug is found in remote access code, then you can be confident that Apple will update the Apple TV&#x27;s firmware, as opposed to an IOT device from a will-be-bankrupt company.<p>Now what if you have a rogue device on your local network that is hacking other devices? Well this is where a firewall, as Mickens&#x27; suggests in his talk, can help. Keep in mind that this is a problem for any style of IOT device, and can only really be protected using a firewall. You can actually create something called a bridging firewall that inspects each packet passing through it&#x27;s network interfaces. Currently, I&#x27;ve bought a small WiFi router from MikroTik just for this purpose (only 25 USD). All of my IOT devices (and my less secure devices like printers and audio receivers) are plugged in or associated with my MikroTik device, and the bridging firewall acts as follows:<p>a) drops ethernet packets sent to my main router&#x27;s MAC address\nThis stops any WAN access<p>b) drops ethernet packets sent to my home server&#x27;s MAC address, except for port 67-68\nAllows DHCP<p>c) drops packets sent to any other IOT device<p>And that&#x27;s it! I can generally assume my Linux Desktop and my MacBook are secure enough. A few reasons why this is not overkill. First, it separates my two networks without using any VLAN nonsense (and avahi&#x2F;Bonjour nonsense), and creates a powerful firewall in between the two. Second, it allows my IOT WiFi network to have a different password from my home WiFi network. Third, it doesn&#x27;t slow down my main router&#x27;s WiFi speed, and I would hate to have a 802.11g device slowing down my wireless network. Fourth, I believe the firewall can be set up to stop ARP spoofing.<p>Finally, HomeKit devices are the few IOT device standards that allow you to truly own a device. In fact, after buying the device, you can set up your own local HomeKit Controller in Python (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jlusiardi&#x2F;homekit_python\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jlusiardi&#x2F;homekit_python</a>) meaning you don&#x27;t need to buy anything at all from Apple.", "parent": 17785891.0, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": null, "id": 17786698, "ranking": null, "date": 1534562999000, "year": 2018}, {"by": "cf498", "score": null, "time": 1534574612, "timestamp": 1534574612000, "title": "", "type": "comment", "url": "", "text": "&gt;Start with the Internet of Things example.

Briefly and in my experience and testing, Z Wave devices are more expensive but more compatible with each other.  Z Wave has a longer range without any relays.  Both are very well supported but I think Z Wave is better supported.  Philips Hue is Zigbee as is Tradfri (Ikea).  I&#x27;ve got both USB dongles plugged into a VMWare esxi in a VMware cluster at work and both survive vMotion and are very stable.

Internal only access can be satisfied by using the built in MQTT broker in Home Assistant.<p>Also, consider ESP8266 (or ESP32) devices.  You can get two for \u00a38 on Amazon with pins etc already to slap in a small breadboard.  Note that you can power them using PoE and a PoE to USB converter to get them up to 100m away.  You can fit these things inside the sort of wall mount box you might have for a light switch or ethernet ports.<p>When I&#x27;ve finished testing at work (!)

Granted gigabit fiber links are far from the norm but they&#x27;re gradually increasing and the HN crowd may be more likely to go for them then many, and the hardware in the USG 3P and USG Pro is just old now.<p>&gt;<i>I am puzzled by some of their new offerings\u2014do they really expect any serious commercial customers to install lighting powered by PoE? Perhaps they&#x27;re onto something innovative, but it seems like a distraction from their core business.</i><p>I definitely agree about distractions, though at the same time we should recognize that of course different divisions and people can be doing different things at the same time, development and engineering talent isn&#x27;t necessarily fungible there. Still, they aren&#x27;t a megacorp, overall resources and management bandwidth isn&#x27;t unlimited either.<p>On the other hand at one point Ubiquiti had a real effort in the IOT space called MFi, but due to a lot of internal technical debt issues there (IIRC there) it essentially got canned, and they planned to eventually resurrect it on top of their more advanced foundations but haven&#x27;t had the bandwidth. Maybe the lighting and their efforts to improve their security offerings are some first baby steps towards getting back into that? In fairness IOT has some of the same properties in terms of suckage that have made their networking efforts successful, and could also be a major market. Updates are often a pain or non-existent, the security story is awful, and much of it insists on using 3rd party cloud dependencies. There could be a real valuable hole there for Ubiquiti to fill were they to execute well enough, though I&#x27;d feel better about it if their core felt more tightly managed and foundations a bit steadier. We&#x27;ll see I guess, and at least lighting should have been a pretty low R&amp;D way experiment with it?<p>---<p>1: And for better or worse, the very fact of a piece of cheaper networking gear seeing years of support and improvements is depressingly unusual in the industry.", "parent": 17908882.0, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": null, "id": 17909109, "ranking": null, "date": 1536069939000, "year": 2018}, {"by": "chriscal", "score": null, "time": 1536071628, "timestamp": 1536071628000, "title": "", "type": "comment", "url": "", "text": "Octopart | New York City | Multiple Positions | Full Time | Onsite<p>Octopart (YC W07) is a search engine for electronic parts.

Am I supposed to strictly segment everything?</i><p>Frankly yes, or at least it should be in the back of your mind when you inevitably need to upgrade some gear down the road anyway and thus the marginal cost is lower. People on HN talking about Ubiquiti probably sounds like a broken record at this point and there are certainly other providers and solutions, but you should recognize that solid centralized management and VLAN functionality and the like now has fairly good SoHo options at SoHo pricing too. You don&#x27;t need to run right out and buy stuff, particularly since 802.11ax looks like it&#x27;ll be a much more significant general upgrade then anything since the original AC with its focus on more efficient utilization rather then theoreticals.<p>But when you do, you should be getting something that lets you trivially soft-segment your network at will. At the least shoving IOT, any VoIP, and any cameras onto their own VLANs separate from your main systems is a good idea (not just for security but it can help performance too for VoIP, if you ever use it). At this point particularly with IOT I&#x27;d consider that a minimum required feature for any network gear to even be on the list for an upgrade.<p>&gt;<i>At what point does prudence and caution drift into paranoia?</i><p>At the point where hacks aren&#x27;t trivially automatable for drive by and the difficulty of anything more is higher then the value of getting your stuff. When it comes to IOT though that point is regrettably a long long LONG way off, the security practices in that space are so utterly abysmal even before the typical practice of no updates ever comes in, assuming it&#x27;s not actively backdoored. And of course this isn&#x27;t just about you, IOT botnets are a threat to the whole net.<p>There certainly can be histrionics around this stuff that aren&#x27;t justified, but I don&#x27;t think basic segmentation, firewalling, pi-hole, and (if you must have your IOT on the public net though really you should consider using a VPN instead please) strict IP whitelist access or at least rate limits are unreasonable at all.
