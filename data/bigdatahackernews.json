At work, we have to keep an eye on nearly 100 servers - most are virtual machines. We wrote a tool that fits our exact monitoring needs (monitors a particular process, and various attributes about it) and have been collecting data on a per-minute basis from all 100 servers - we have quite a bit of data collected thus far. We're storing all of this data in MongoDB at this point.<p>The second part of our goal is to be able to view reports via an intranet web app. These reports are going to include data from <i>all</i> 100 servers, or that's our goal anyways. We'd like to start off by simply sorting these servers by CPU usage (we're storing CPU usage for each server, every minute), and viewing a graph of CPU usage over time.<p>First, uneducated plan of attack would be to simply run a report generating routine every minute or so that does the big query and stores that data set on a per minute basis.

In early 2010 I launched my first product which also happens to be my first large scale programming project (I dont have a CS background). The product is a niche tool within the larger enterprise data management space. Recently a prospect has been in talks with me to basically acquire me for talent.  They are actually not very interested in the IP, rather they like my experience around bigData.<p>This is essentially a solo operation with 0 investors.  I have developed some partnerships to help me sell the product and I have a few customers (small deals) and a couple more in the pipeline.<p>My main motivation to even consider this opportunity is because the position they are offering me will allow me to experiment with bigger ideas in the same space (bigData) and work with more seasoned programmers.

These users from both academia and industry generally do what we call \"scientific computing.\" A couple examples are oil companies doing immense amounts of geophysics simulations, and bioinformatics laboratories in universities doing comparative genomics; we'll be posting a guest blog entry in the next week on successfully reducing the time of sequence alignment from 20-25 hours to less than an hour. Other examples include neuroscience, astronomy, seismology, weather analysis, and protein folding.<p>As time has gone on, we have noticed two sizable class of users who we consider to be non-scientific. The first are the risk analysis divisions of financial firms who run Monte Carlo simulations in their never-ending endeavors to determine their portfolio's risk profile. The second are web companies doing all sorts of background processing: video encoding, feed aggregation, social data scraping, and analytics of all sorts.<p>The REST feature is an experiment on many levels. In the short term, it helps our existing users utilize PiCloud without Python, which is very important in companies with large polyglot codebases (read: Java). In the medium term, we want to see whether there's adequate interest from web and mobile companies who require serious scalability, and thus are interested by how we entirely divorce their algorithms from their servers. In the long term, we want to see how far we can take the idea of \"publishing\" a function; there are many users out there who would love to share their algorithms in <i>working form</i> but lack the programming know how and computing hardware to do it.<p>To answer your other questions: We're releasing a BigData a la MapReduce solution for our users in the coming months. Also, Python has a strong scientific computing community primarily because it interoperates very well with existing C/C++/Fortran code via extensions. In most of our use cases, Python is being used as a wrapper for C code, which is doing the heavy lifting. PiCloud, unlike many of the other background processing services, allows users to deploy more than just Python or Ruby code. We used to allow this through a \"package upload\" system, but we've recently just replaced it (in beta) with the ability to fully customize a file system environment (apt-get away!).<p>Our users are able to access their databases, often times without any code modifications, from PiCloud, which means their Django models work just fine. If their database resides on EC2 us-east, then the performance hit is minimal.<p>We just did a quick non-scientific check of our enqueue time from an EC2 us-east server to PiCloud. A cold start (first job) takes 900ms (It could take longer depending on what needs to get transferred), but once the connection has been made, enqueue takes around 86ms, and as the system heats up it reduces to 50ms.", "parent": 2999340.0, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": null, "id": 2999977, "ranking": null, "date": 1316089847000, "year": 2011}, {"by": "timf", "score": 2.0, "time": 1316464592, "timestamp": 1316464592000, "title": "Big Data, Stupid Decisions", "type": "story", "url": "http://www.slideshare.net/ipeirotis/big-data-stupid-decisions-9326862", "text": "", "parent": null, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": 0.0, "id": 3015103, "ranking": null, "date": 1316464592000, "year": 2011}, {"by": "robot", "score": 1.0, "time": 1316491050, "timestamp": 1316491050000, "title": "What is Hadoop?

When you are just starting out, a big database of everything is probably good enough. Chose a solid, widely used data store (MySQL, Postgres, Mongo, Oracle, MSSQL, etc) and use it. Do as little in this layer as you can - it's going to be the most expensive and difficult to scale. Put your business logic elsewhere. Protect it from read spikes with a cache. Design your schemas carefully.</i><p>I disagree with some of this.  In general the worst db scaling I have seen are ones with large numbers of simple queries based on the idea of doing as little in the db as you can.  Instead I would suggest two principles regarding making the db a little more scaling-friendly:<p>1)  Everything that needs to be queried together should be queried together.  Don't do lots of round trips and simple queries.<p>2)  Don't do stuff in your database that it isn't designed to do.  Write good queries, but don't do things like send emails from the db backend.<p>A corollary here is that you should write your queries with performance in mind but not do too much premature optimization.  For example, it's a lot easier to go from a group by to a sparse index scan (using a stored proc or a CTE) than it is to lock yourself into a sparse index scan from the get go.<p>In general, the four points you mention though are extremely well thought out.  Following up on #4, although technology is important sometimes (esp. newly maturing technologies here like Postgres-xc), these are going to be far more useful where an app is well designed than where it is not.

People who are interested (and especially experienced) in distributed control systems using web platforms - read on! Would love to hear your thoughts and have some guidance through the fog of too many ways to skin a metaphor.<p>I am the lead-and-presently-only developer for a new distributed system control platform consisting of:<p>------<p>1.Distributed units: Initially few (&#60;100) but eventually thousands (in a couple of years) of embedded systems which are scattered all over the place doing 'stuff'. Each unit has a (probably cellular) internet connection (though eventually we may try to use a local area radio mesh to cluster them to share a single connection... or piggyback on a nearby wifi). They are fixed installations. For development I'm using the mBed platform (Cortex M3) as there's an existing community, libraries, and hardware... these few being of far higher value than custom hardware or advanced debug tools at this stage.\nEach of these units has enough brains to look after itself in the short term when necessary/in event of unexpected outages (up to 1 min or so with no observable negative impact) but should generally be 'online' and able to respond to higher level commands (start; stop; rollover; reset; increase output to y; change parameters b, c, and d) with low latency (preferably below 100ms, but could live with 1s if this changes everything completely). They also need to be able to feed data up to the higher level controller, preferably also in soft real time (perhaps 20 variables of 16ish bit each, once per second... though in reality will only send when there is a delta).<p>2. Data connection: A connection/protocol able to reliably and securely support this sort of communication. As mentioned I'm not talking banks/trains/nuclear-plants reliability and security... but should be at least 'I want to read my email online when I feel like it, and stop curious and somewhat sinister people reading it at the same time' level.<p>3. Controller/Server/Database/analytics: Central controller that can aggregate all this incoming data and send out new set points etc based on decisions made at central level. Data should be stored for future retrieval and continuous analysis, preferably in some form that lends itself to various (somewhat simplistic to start with) 'Big Data' type analytical and optimization processes.<p>4. Some sort of browser based front end so curious owners of the distributed systems can log in and see how there flock is going.<p>-------<p>For my background - I'm an electrical engineer; have experience developing in C/C++ (though mostly from a control implementation perspective, and supported by much more capable software engineers for the tricky OS stuff) for hard real time systems. Have almost no experience at all with servers, clouds, interwebs, etc.<p>Since starting this project I've managed to hack together the framework of a rough demo with a LAMP stack server, reasonable facsimile of what we want for the front end (coded up from scratch in HTML/CSS, using Ajax for most of the server I/O - I'm so proud!) and as mentioned the mBed as the distributed target. Everything does not yet work elegantly, but most of the parts do, and I can more or less see how to get from here to 'working' demo.<p>The issue, and hence question (finally!): I'm sure I haven't built this in anything like an optimal way... and probably not even an adequate way for what I want the system to do in a few years. So where do I go from here?$<p>There are tens (hundreds) or possible candidates for the server, for the database, for the connection.\nDo I use MySQL? MongoDB? NoSQL? A big long text file?\nDo I use HTTP? Modbus/TCPIP? Carrier pigeons with a highly refined bribe system?\nDo I use Apache? Node.js? Tornado?<p>From playing around with the mBed I discovered Tornado and Websockets. Websockets at least seem to provide a lot of the functionality I want for the connection between 1 &#38; 3 (distributed units and central controllers). So I'm beginning to dig into Tornado a bit and see if that's the right thing, but am painfully aware that I'm feeling my way in a dark room filled with things that I wouldn't recognize half of even with the lights ON.<p>So, if anyone remains after this too-long background: What would you suggest as a stack to build all this on? I guess my key question is about level 3 (the OS/DB/Server/Scripting/whatever), but also about whether secure-websockets are a good solution for level 2 considering the data requirements (1000 units+, 100 bytes data/unit.second during peak periods, some delays acceptable during peaks, bidirectional data flow).<p>For now I'll keep looking at Tornado/wss and trying to get them to work properly with my mBed (there are some reasonable walk throughs on the mBed website I'm following, so I'm not completely in the dark) but would very much appreciate some input from an wiser and more experienced soul (or just wiser/smarter - I'm not proud!).<p>Thanks in advance...", "parent": null, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": 1.0, "id": 3314806, "ranking": null, "date": 1323097228000, "year": 2011}, {"by": "shep", "score": 2.0, "time": 1323193447, "timestamp": 1323193447000, "title": "Novel grassroots technology meetup group in New York needs Your help", "type": "story", "url": "", "text": "Hi HN<p>I am the organizer of a technology meetup group in New York that focuses on GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) technologies for supercomputing with 'big data' and 'big compute'. The group started with just one member (me!) on the 11th January 2011 and now numbers 338 people. We're all practitioners in GPU ... all experts ... and that's the problem!<p>Few people in my group understand the economics and business aspects of GPU as an emerging technology. I think, as practitioners, we should understand the market and business we are in. We don't. Basic facts such as market size, growth rate, areas of application, the companies involved ... just aren't at our fingertips, and they should be.<p>Moreover, there is a huge amount of talent in the meetup group. Gosh, we have people with algorithms named after them! But I fear that much of that talent is underutilized.<p>For these reasons, I have organized a special meetup on \"The Business of GPUs\" that brings together practitioners, GPU companies, analysts, VCs, Angel Investors, and talent scouts -- just to see what happens by putting all these people together in one room. I think the results will be interesting! I hope you think so too as I would like to invite any HN member who can make it along (and if you can't come, that you will send a friend or colleague instead).<p>You can find out more details and register to attend (if you want to come) by following this link: http://www.meetup.com/HPC-GPU-Supercomputing-Group-of-New-York/events/36237782/<p>Incidentally, if you are unfamiliar with GPU technology it may help to know that massively parallel processing -- specifically using GPUs -- is finding much wider application in many areas: finance, media, scientific, biomedical, defense, 'big data', 'big compute', Cloud computing and many others. GPUs spectacularly speed up many applications -- by x10, x100 ... even x1000 in exceptional cases -- and by doing so they are changing the rules of the business game. GPUs are a great technology for both 'big data' and 'big compute'; two challenges that these days most often go together. We are entering a golden age of computational discovery in which we will be able to ask -- and get answers -- to questions we never thought possible; GPU technology is helping bring that golden age about.<p>All the best, Shep", "parent": null, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": 2.0, "id": 3320087, "ranking": null, "date": 1323193447000, "year": 2011}, {"by": "Emdub", "score": 1.0, "time": 1323216161, "timestamp": 1323216161000, "title": "Video: Realtime Analytics for Big Data: A Facebook Case Study", "type": "story", "url": "http://marakana.com/forums/java/general/562.html", "text": "", "parent": null, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": 0.0, "id": 3321766, "ranking": null, "date": 1323216161000, "year": 2011}, {"by": "tilt", "score": 1.0, "time": 1323358482, "timestamp": 1323358482000, "title": "IBM to buy DemandTec to help big data meet commerce", "type": "story", "url": "http://gigaom.com/2011/12/08/ibm-to-buy-demandtec-to-help-big-data-meet-commerce/", "text": "", "parent": null, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": 0.0, "id": 3329451, "ranking": null, "date": 1323358482000, "year": 2011}, {"by": "aidanclash", "score": 1.0, "time": 1323365222, "timestamp": 1323365222000, "title": "Questions for HP and its Autonomy/Vertica Big Data Analytics Platform", "type": "story", "url": "http://wikibon.org/blog/questions-for-hp-and-its-autonomyvertica-big-data-analytics-platform/", "text": "", "parent": null, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": 0.0, "id": 3330025, "ranking": null, "date": 1323365222000, "year": 2011}, {"by": "robdoherty2", "score": 1.0, "time": 1323496322, "timestamp": 1323496322000, "title": "My journey to big data nirvana- Telling it like it is...", "type": "story", "url": "http://cassandra-hadoop.blogspot.com/2011/12/journal-of-my-voyage-to-big-data.html", "text": "", "parent": null, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": 0.0, "id": 3337065, "ranking": null, "date": 1323496322000, "year": 2011}, {"by": "MarsToday", "score": 1.0, "time": 1323782728, "timestamp": 1323782728000, "title": "Finding meaning before it is evident - the future of big data?", "type": "story", "url": "http://scandinavianstartups.com/article/swedish-startup-gavagai-exclusive-interview", "text": "Swedish startup Gavagai competes for the lucrative big data mining trend analysis market.", "parent": null, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": 0.0, "id": 3347387, "ranking": null, "date": 1323782728000, "year": 2011}, {"by": "jph00", "score": null, "time": 1323805407, "timestamp": 1323805407000, "title": "", "type": "comment", "url": "", "text": "(Disclaimer: I'm the \"accidental scientist\" profiled in this article.)<p>Yes I've noticed this as well.

Why or why not?\"<p>Thanks!<p>Here is the article: http://informationweek.com/news/global-cio/interviews/232301236", "parent": null, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": 8.0, "id": 3425206, "ranking": null, "date": 1325701316000, "year": 2012}, {"by": "thenextcorner", "score": 1.0, "time": 1325790555, "timestamp": 1325790555000, "title": "Big Data and the infinite possibilities for the travel industry", "type": "story", "url": "http://www.tnooz.com/2012/01/04/how-to/big-data-and-the-infinite-possibilities-for-the-travel-industry/", "text": "", "parent": null, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": 0.0, "id": 3429985, "ranking": null, "date": 1325790555000, "year": 2012}, {"by": "skempe", "score": 9.0, "time": 1325875737, "timestamp": 1325875737000, "title": "Graph Databases: Connecting the Dots in Big Data", "type": "story", "url": "http://www.dataversity.net/archives/7736", "text": "", "parent": null, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": 0.0, "id": 3434486, "ranking": null, "date": 1325875737000, "year": 2012}, {"by": "muzz", "score": 2.0, "time": 1325919739, "timestamp": 1325919739000, "title": "Using Spark and Hive to process BigData at Conviva", "type": "story", "url": "http://www.conviva.com/blog/engineering/using-spark-and-hive-to-process-bigdata-at-conviva", "text": "", "parent": null, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": 0.0, "id": 3436445, "ranking": null, "date": 1325919739000, "year": 2012}, {"by": "nwlinux", "score": 1.0, "time": 1325967835, "timestamp": 1325967835000, "title": "The problem of Big Data is not storage", "type": "story", "url": "http://nwlinux.com/the-problem-of-big-data-is-not-storage/", "text": "", "parent": null, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": 0.0, "id": 3437982, "ranking": null, "date": 1325967835000, "year": 2012}, {"by": "winniechimp", "score": 1.0, "time": 1326135088, "timestamp": 1326135088000, "title": "Infochimps introduces new Big Data Platform for Enterprises", "type": "story", "url": "http://blog.infochimps.com/2012/01/09/meet-the-infochimps-platform-for-enterprises/", "text": "", "parent": null, "deleted": null, "dead": true, "descendants": -1.0, "id": 3443729, "ranking": null, "date": 1326135088000, "year": 2012}, {"by": "thenextcorner", "score": 4.0, "time": 1326137210, "timestamp": 1326137210000, "title": "What can Big Data Analysts learn from other industries", "type": "story", "url": "http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2012-01/06/big-data-evolution-and-missiles", "text": "", "parent": null, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": 0.0, "id": 3443868, "ranking": null, "date": 1326137210000, "year": 2012}, {"by": "thenextcorner", "score": 3.0, "time": 1326137281, "timestamp": 1326137281000, "title": "Why Big Data Analytics is The Next Big Opportunity for Outsourcing", "type": "story", "url": "http://hkotadia.com/archives/4687", "text": "", "parent": null, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": 0.0, "id": 3443875, "ranking": null, "date": 1326137281000, "year": 2012}, {"by": "thenextcorner", "score": 1.0, "time": 1326137370, "timestamp": 1326137370000, "title": "Generating Big Data for Use with SQL Azure and Hadoop", "type": "story", "url": "http://oakleafblog.blogspot.com/2012/01/generating-big-data-for-use-with-sql.html", "text": "", "parent": null, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": 0.0, "id": 3443879, "ranking": null, "date": 1326137370000, "year": 2012}, {"by": "upstartmafia", "score": 2.0, "time": 1326138508, "timestamp": 1326138508000, "title": "Will Lean Startups Make Academia Irrelevant?

It doesn't \"slurp data out of internal databases\". It's just a DFS coupled with a MapReduce implementation. Perhaps you're thinking of Hive?<p>&#62; Currently there are no solutions for transferring data between different organizations\u2019 hadoop installations.<p>All data isn't \"big data\". By being myopically hadoop-focused, you're ignoring the real problem, which is data interchange. XML was supposed to be the golden standard; it's debatable how far it's achieved its initial goal.<p>&#62; So some publishing technology that would connect hadoop\u2019s HDFS to the .data domain<p>So basically, forsake all internal business logic, access control, and just pipe your database to the net? When you have a hammer...<p>&#62; Transferring terabytes of data is non-trivial. But if the data is published to a cloud provider, others can access it without having to create their own copy, and it can be computed upon within the high-speed internal network of the provider<p>See AWS public datasets for exactly this, but it's still a long shot.

The reason is computation.<p>The problem isn't data interchange formats and ideal representations, the problem is being able to compute with data. Distributed computation can then be used to solve all the other problems.<p>Case in point: Slurping data out of databases. Apache Sqoop leverages the primitives provided by Hadoop, in terms of partitioning and fault tolerance, to make it easier to do massive data transfers out of existing databases.<p>Another example of a solution coming from the hadoop perspective: Avro. It beats the pants of off XML as a data interchange format, precisely because it makes computing with the data (which is the ultimate point) easier.<p>Now, there is a reason I called Hadoop the integration point. It is becoming a general purpose computation system, which at the same time is also the datawarehouse for organizational data. So rather than dealing with the details of proprietary commercial systems, programmers can target applications to the open-source hadoop ecosystem, and have those solutions be reusable and customizable on a large scale.<p>The \"publishing solution\" would of course deal with access control, business logic, freshness, etc. That is exactly what I'm advocating be built.<p>Individual pieces of data may not be big data, but the aggregate problem still is.

Directors, effective immediately. An experienced entrepreneur and corporate executive with more than two decades of experience, Palmer will help shape and accelerate the growth of Cloudant.<p>Palmer was co-founder and founding CEO of Vertica Systems (acquired by HP). With a proven track record of seven successful startups including two IPOs in the past 20 years, Palmer has specialized in accelerating the foundation and growth of early-stage companies that span enterprise software, the Internet, ecommerce, and biotech. Prior to Vertica, Palmer was the senior vice president of operations and CIO for Infinity Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: INFI) and has held executive positions at Bowstreet (acquired by IBM), pcOrder.com and Trilogy.<p>\u201cCloudant was founded on a brilliant premise: the data layer is something you should grow into, not out of,\u201d said Palmer. \u201cThe unique technology behind the Cloudant Data Layer makes discontinuous and expensive data management infrastructure upgrades a thing of the past. But Cloudant goes beyond just continuous scaling. With Cloudant it is much easier for developers to add innovative analytics, text search, off-line computing, geo-location and other features to their web and mobile apps. I\u2019m psyched to join the Cloudant team as it shapes the future of web and mobile application development.\"<p>Palmer has recently served as a founding board member for several other cloud and big data startups, including CloudSwitch (acquired by Verizon), Goby (acquired by Telenav), Recorded Future, VoltDB and Paradigm4.<p>\u201cAndy is a visionary technology leader with a brilliant entrepreneurial track record,\u201d said Derek Schoettle, CEO of Cloudant. \u201cAndy\u2019s experience growing early stage companies and in Big Data will be invaluable in helping to shape Cloudant\u2019s ongoing strategic and operational focus.\u201d<p>The Cloudant Data Layer<p>Cloudant is a scalable data layer (as a service) for big data applications. Built on the Apache CouchDB document database, JSON, and MapReduce, it lets developers focus on new features instead of the drudgery of growing or migrating databases. The Cloudant Data Layer is already big. It collects, stores, analyzes and distributes application data across a global network of secure, high-performance data centers, delivering low-latency, non-stop data access to users no matter where they're located. Cloudant is available as a single- or multi-tenant service.<p>Cloudant is free to start. To sign up for Cloudant, or for more information, please visit www.cloudant.com.<p>About Cloudant, Inc.<p>Cloudant, the company that builds and manages The Cloudant Data Layer, was founded in Cambridge MA in 2008 by three MIT Physicists. Frustrated by the available tools for managing and analyzing Big Data in their research, the founders set out to build a distributed, fault-tolerant, globally scalable data layer for applications, a platform that would free developers to focus on their applications knowing that they would never outgrow their data layer. Cloudant\u2019s service helps power thousands of applications in organizations of all shapes and sizes, from lone developers to the Fortune 100. The Cloudant team is composed of experts in distributed systems, database technology, web services, and Big Data analysis. It proudly counts Avalon Ventures and Y Combinator among its investors.

While it may sound like a setup for a romantic comedy, the fact that a plucky and attractive female has yet to make an apparence has made it painfully clear that it's not going to be that kind of a movie. So, before the cement dries on what was intended to be a very short-term situation and I find myself greeting shoppers at Walmart, I've decided to buy a one-way ticket to SF where there seems to be plenty of opportunity for the likes of me. The only problem is that I don't have a job, an interview, or even any connections I can leverage.<p>But if you need help solving hard problems, I'm your guy. I have an undergraduate degree in Mathematics from the University of Chicago and a masters in Mathematics from Iowa State. I know C++ and Python ok and I've worked as a derivatives quant, a high-frequency trader and even tried my hand at poker for a while.

I started my project with a good technical co-founder, but he is having trouble committing the project and has to focus on paying work. The product concept is pretty detailed and well-thought-out.<p>What I am hoping for is someone who has an interest in working with music culture. The product is really easy to be passionate about if you are a musician, a producer, or are related to, friends with, or sleeping with one. This isn't a hard requirement, but it will help you understand the customer and his or her needs and how the product solves them. Musicians I have talked to get it instantly, and non-musicians tend to need a little convincing.<p>From  a technical point of view, there will be a lot of big data, relatively complex algorithms, and machine learning involved.<p>I am a lightweight coder from my UI background, so I can be a padawan coder or do unit testing when there is a lull in the design work.<p>It should go without saying, but I'll say it anyway: I have a good design for a good product concept, but I am looking for an actual partner, not an engineering bitch. The long-term success of this product will be based on the ingenuity and creativity we bring to the engineering. I want to build a successful partnership with someone who can take technical ownership of this and work with me to create something amazing.<p>So if you are looking for a project to work on or to apply with, then give me a few minutes over the phone or skype or in-person and I'll tell you what I'm up to and why I think it will be a success.<p>I am based in Cupertino, CA.\nI am gabe kneisley at

Let me give you my thoughts on it.<p>Your impression about the hype is correct.  There are a lot of vendors offering BIG solutions, if you pay them BIGGER money.  Where I used to translate the word enterprise to $$, now I translate Big Data to $$$$$$$.<p>When I'm hiring, I don't go looking for Big Data people, because generally they don't exist.  Statistics is a really great general addition to a programmers toolkit.  Machine Learning is valuable as well, although in my experience the application is more limited.  What this article doesn't mention is a whole host of other skills required.<p>Modeling, and not just a formal mathematical model, but applying any type of model to your data to get insight.  Check out the model-thinking class on coursera.<p>Exploratory Data Analysis, much different skill than confirmatory statistics.<p>Design of Experiments, specialized subfield within statistics.<p>Logistics, how to setup, maintain, and maximally utilize an efficient distributed cluster and build a pipeline getting your data to the cluster, cleaning it, building it into a model, and then extracting insight and delivering that end value.<p>Those are a couple of the skills at a high level.  At a more nuts and bolts level, Hadoop is the defacto standard for Big Data.  Learning how to build a data pipeline out of the Linux tool chain is very common in the data science world.<p>The overall value stream for Big Data is deep and wide.  Most companies don't have expertise in much of these, and so at the current time you have to learn them yourself or find a company focused on building a team around it.<p>If you are just learning this yourself, you'll probably get an academic knowledge.  If you want to make yourself valuable in the marketplace, you'll really want to get hands on experience.  Knowing a z-score is one thing, building a process to gather data and compute a model against it is a whole different ball game.  As the article mentions, if you have nice clean data it's easy to apply a model.  If you have messy ugly data from 20 different vendors and 200 clients with various failures, anomalies, and you have to figure out what type of model is helpful, oh and you have a deadline because for 500th time someone promised something impossible to the client, then you have something closer to what Big Data is today.<p>* grammar edits", "parent": 3902818.0, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": null, "id": 3902872, "ranking": null, "date": 1335619093000, "year": 2012}, {"by": "tgflynn", "score": null, "time": 1335621880, "timestamp": 1335621880000, "title": "", "type": "comment", "url": "", "text": "Another thing that increases difficulty is that depending on people's background and experience there are very different views on what is most important.<p>For example is my view exploratory data analysis and visualization are less important than using strong models and figuring out how to apply them to problems.

I'm sure the author's points are true in their world, but largely they aren't in mine (mostly online media stuff). Here's a rebuttal of a sort:<p>This data collection is a recent phenomenon: only since media moved online has it been cheap enough to collect sufficient data to do interesting things. Furthermore, you can actually use that data is more meaningful ways (e.g. recommendation systems) that weren't possible before.<p>That value is not being extracted by the companies that do currently collect data: surprisingly true from my discussions with media companies. The largest companies (Yahoo!, Netflix, etc.) sure do, but the second tier don't.<p>That companies will need outside help to extract insights: This perhaps indicative of the biggest difference between our worlds. It seems the author is talking about batch jobs, where you do some rudimentary analysis on a data, makes some slides, present to management, and go home. The people I know are talking about deploying automated systems into production (think recommendation systems again). This requires a large array of skills (machine learning, software engineering, distributed systems, etc.) that many companies don't have. \"Minitab, SAS, SPSS, Systat\" are not sufficient tools in this world.<p>The insights gathered from ever larger data sets have more value and are more accurate than insights gathered from smaller data sets: The conventional wisdom in machine learning is that more data trumps more sophisticated algorithms.

We want to make it as easy to use as Game Center on the iPhone, but for games in the physical world too. :)<p>Why do this?<p>Statistics are poorly managed and as a result people are overlooked for a variety of biased reasons and perceived flaws.<p>We feel that Sandbag.gr sits at the nexus of several trends in the venture backed space and that now is the optimal time to enter the market with a peer-2-peer skill ranking product.<p>Big Data - For years country clubs, local athletic clubs, and student athletic associations, have kept track of sports data independently. This data, although sometimes streamlined on a national level in the case of the USGA, remains largely disorganized. There lies a huge opportunity to organize this data and apply it in a fun and intuitive way. For example, Muthu Alagappan, a Stanford University Senior, recently used a data set from the NBA 2011-2012 season on 452 players to determine which positions would best serve their strengths. In analyzing the data he created 13 new positions to better describe the way each player participates in scoring points for the team. One fun example that he pointed out was that statistically Rajon Rondo of the Boston Celtics had more in common with Miami Heat forward Shane Battier than with fellow point guard Tony Parker of the San Antonio Spurs. Alagappan built his database with the following fields: points, rebounds, assists, steals, blocked shots, turnovers and fouls. These are stats that every athletic association in the first world keeps. The same observations that Alagappan made about professional players could be applied to the high school or adult recreational level making gameplay more fun and preventing young players from being \"undervalued\" by the coaches, scouts, and fans.  Muthu's experiment is just one example of how sports data can be utilized when organized in a standardized way. Further more, Xbox Live and Apple Game Center have data about all video games played. With the help of the unofficial Xbox API and Apple Game Center API all of this data could be ported to Sandbaggr.\nSmartphone and Tablet Proliferation- There were an estimated 487 million smartphones shipped in 2011, and tablet computer proliferation is growing exponentially. Dozens of score card apps have popped up on smartphones making it easier and easier to keep score on an iPad or iPhone than in a book. This presents a phenomenal opportunity for Sandbag.gr to cater to anyone from jet setters keeping each other in line while playing a skins game on the golf course to athletic associations keeping track of their team's stats in real time on an ipad. \nReal Time - The rise of derby.js and meteor have proven that time time is ripe for a realtime consumer web applications to be deployed. Although these projects and their brethren are still in their infancy, many sports associations across the country still use traditional pen and paper as a means of keeping track. Realtime applications allow coaches and scorekeepers to update the statistics they are recording in real time, and would allow audiences, coaches, and players to engage with those statistics immediately. Although this has become commonplace for professional and college sports, game statistics methodology remains in the same state it has been since the 1950's. \nGamification - One of the most popular buzzwords among marketing communities in lie of Four Square's success has been \"gamification.\" It seems like everyone in a marketing role has been professing the inevitable gamification of western consumerism(i.e. badges for buying stuff). At Sandbag.gr we think its silly to spend time \"gamifying\" things such as shopping or watching T.V. when games and sports that people play every day and have been playing for years have not been optimized by Web 2.0 technologies. Having said that, we think the implementation of badges and awards, in a way that has been fun and successful with XBox live, would add another level of competition to sportsmanship.\np2p Meetups - We love DinnerForStrangers and think it is extremely innovative. We think the same \"matchmaking\"/ \"geo-social\" principles that ideas like DinnerForStrangers and Match.com use to match people nearby can apply to pick-up games and challenges.<p>Monetization<p>Ideally we would like Sandbag.gr to be free for anyone to use, but because it is important for there to be an ultimate strategy we have brainstormed a few monetization scenarios.<p>Goods upgrades - EA made a phenomenal foray in the the internet gaming space in 2010 with the creation of Tiger Woods online which allowed users to customize their player by buying different clubs and shoes. We think that advertising and specific product upgrades in real life such as shoes and could be fun way to rack up affiliate Amazon \nSkilled Game Wagers - When handicaps are more open and honest, everyone who wants to put a friendly skilled gaming wager with a friend has the ability to do so in a safe and controlled environment.  Companies such as Betfair and . Skilled gaming betting for physical games remains largely legal within the United States and other economies.\nCharge - If all else fails we think a subscription model could be viable alternative. This model has worked within the Golf Community. Currently golf rankings are kept by the USGA through a system called Golf Handicap Index Number (GHIN) although the rankings are free to view, to keep track of the rankings through your usually costs $30-50 a month through a country club. We believe we can dramatically reduce this cost (probably to zero). \nIn the last five year, startups like Groupon/Living Social and fun things like StrangersForDinner have challenged us to go outside and engage socially with the world around us, but there are exists a wide range things that have yet to be modernized with the technologies that have largely democratized other aspects of daily life. There are plenty of fun things that people can do without paying for a coupon. Sport is part of our culture. We don't know why we like sports, but for some reason they're important to us. :)<p>Conclusion<p>At Sandbag.gr we're a small group of engineers, economics geeks, and entrepreneurs that want to make the world of sports and games more open and honest. We think there are huge inefficiencies throughout the world in the way we evaluate each other.<p>The list of things that we can do with well organized data is endless, but we want to start small. Right now we are developing a simple ELO ranking system that can be applied to everything from rap battles to arm wrestling (2). We think the next step are sports where handicaps play a large role like golf or bowling.<p>So sign up for the beta, ask us a question, or reach out to us and get involved to show us what you got.

In many ways I have a lot more data then big data mining companies like comscore have and I know they're making a killing off of selling their data.<p>This is why I'm posting here.

I'd like to fully grasp these concepts so my head doesn't hurt anymore.<p>I'm used to dealing with an ORM like active record. When I imagine my user objects through rails I picture an object of a person being related to a row in the people table. Ok basic.<p>So, I read that non-relational databases like mongodb aren't just cool because they're \"fast with big data\" but they're also cool because they apparently make developing more natural with an oop language (why?). Then I also read that most design patterns probably aren't truly relational. Ok, this is where I get lost.<p>1) What are some fundamental examples of relational design and non-relational design? 2) similar to above, what are examples of structured data vs unstructured (is this just rephrasing above?)<p>So, given those things I feel (in my immediate ignorance) that almost every type of project I've attempted to model against has been relational. But maybe I'm just using semantics over technicality. For example, posts and comments. Relational to each other. Add users in there. it seems most apps these days have data that is always useful to reach through other data/objects. That's relational isn't it?<p>How about something describing something less typical.<p>Let's say I was building a workout tracker app. I have users, exercises, workouts, routines and log_entries.<p>I create a routine to group workouts. A workout is a group of exercises. I record my reps and weight through log entries for my exercises. Is this relational data or non relational? Would mongo be great for modeling this or awful?<p>I hear things like statistics come into play. How does that affect the above example? What statistics are people usually speaking of?<p>Let's say I added tracking other things, like a users weight, height, body fat and so on. How does that affect things?<p>Thank you for taking the time to help me understand.<p>Edit: can anyone explain why it may be easier to develop for one over the other. Is using something like mongo more agile both because it \"clicks\" more once you \"ge it\" and also because you don't need to run migrations?<p>Another thing, when using an abstraction like an ORM - does it really matter? If so when? To me the initial value would be the ease of querying data and modeling my objects. Whatever lets me do that easier is what I'd be happy with.

I'd love to hear more discussion of how big data has already started this process.<p>Examples I can think of (and I'd love to hear more): \n- weather analysis for farmers (weatherbill / the climate corporation)\n- marketing (the target pregnancy example - <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/19/magazine/shopping-habits.html?pagewanted=all\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/19/magazine/shopping-habits.h...</a>)<p>More examples?", "parent": 4371494.0, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": null, "id": 4371688, "ranking": null, "date": 1344740538000, "year": 2012}, {"by": "crayola", "score": null, "time": 1344765327, "timestamp": 1344765327000, "title": "", "type": "comment", "url": "", "text": "The buzz around big data, let's not forget, is partly fuelled by bullshit generated by vendors of big data solutions and analytic firms.<p>It probably does not really need to be repeated, but I guess it cannot hurt.

Often this gets subjected to a monstrously complex architecture for no good reason.<p>Generally most of these cases can be addressed and solved with as simple a tool like sqlite! And all you generally need is something like Perl with sqlite and ability to write simple SQL queries.<p>People get deceived very easily, When they look at GB scale XML files they think that is what big data is. Yet most of that generally and easily goes into a traditional RDBMS. And the performance is generally is in pretty acceptable limits. Mark up eats a lot of space and data size. When converted to flat file structures like csv's, tsv's and then imported to a RDBMS the data sizes are way smaller. I've some times seen an order of 10x difference.<p>Another annoying thing is abuse of NoSQL databases.

Migrations would be a pain under this system, but mitigated by the fact that the complexity is being handled by the tool.<p>This stored procedure then writes to the database of record and then sends a series of updates to, essentially a system of real-time materialized views that serve the same purpose as the standard NoSQL schema.<p>The lambda architecture purposes would still be fulfilled with lower data-side complexity. After I read through Big Data I'll revisit this with a more nuanced view, but I wonder if hadoop and nosql really give you anything.", "parent": 4572872.0, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": null, "id": 4575070, "ranking": null, "date": 1348658832000, "year": 2012}, {"by": "tech77", "score": 2.0, "time": 1348662823, "timestamp": 1348662823000, "title": "On building an analytical culture for Big Data", "type": "story", "url": "http://data-informed.com/jeanne-harris-how-to-create-analytical-culture/", "text": "", "parent": null, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": 0.0, "id": 4575238, "ranking": null, "date": 1348662823000, "year": 2012}, {"by": "klsvu", "score": 1.0, "time": 1348663641, "timestamp": 1348663641000, "title": "The Problem With Lists - And The Fix From Big Data", "type": "story", "url": "http://lsvp.com/2012/09/25/lets-face-it-todays-lists-are-garbage/", "text": "", "parent": null, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": 0.0, "id": 4575280, "ranking": null, "date": 1348663641000, "year": 2012}, {"by": "cbsmith", "score": null, "time": 1348673898, "timestamp": 1348673898000, "title": "", "type": "comment", "url": "", "text": "&#62; They will not always work for big data, which often means \"max out our storage with crap, don't worry disk is cheap\" eg web metrics<p>Having worked on this kind of stuff myself, I'd have to argue the exact opposite.

We absolutely intend to make it a powerful platform for computation on big datasets.<p>Many people are storing data in S3, and many datasets are sourced from locations on the web or remote data providers, anyway.  With Wakari, you can have extremely efficient access to those datasets via IOPro (<a href=\"http://continuum.io/iopro\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://continuum.io/iopro</a>), which is adding indexing on S3 data in the next version.<p>We will also be adding sharing, collaboration, and publishing features in the next version.

We provide a fully sandboxed Linux environment, accessible via the browser, with a complete installation of Anaconda Pro.  The IPython notebook is an <i>additional</i> feature of Wakari, and not vice versa.<p>One thing we haven't showcased very much is the fact that you have concurrent access to many different Python environments.

The complication is of course that to use these filesystems, one needs to build support for each access protocol into a python module (off the top of my head I'm not sure if they exist yet; perhaps they do). While most of these filesystems do offer standard posix 'mounting', this is usually not recommended for performance reasons.<p>Perhaps I'm outside of the intended use case anyway.

A government currency has forms in which transactions create no paper trail. Bitcoin does not.<p>I did some research on anonymity (mentioned in that document); I find it hard to project how private Bitcoin will be in future.<p>Our impression was that currently many users were careless, and that many identities (in the form of publicly disclosed Bitcoin address ownerships) were linked to meaningful transactions; such that with basic network analysis it was possible to passively observe semantically meaningful transactions, like \"the person who owns this twitter account, which seems to be a real person, donated to wikileaks\" or \"this account which is a public organisation donation address is linked to an address that transferred bitcoins to that other organisation\".<p>We speculated that <i>if</i> Bitcoin became widely used, without changes in usage patterns, then a large e-commerce site (someone like Amazon accepting payments in Bitcoin - leaving questions of scalability aside) could passively observe much of what was going on on the network, because they had so many known identity-address pairs to start with (e.g. shipping addresses).<p>But the other argument is that its probably relatively easy for usage patterns to change.<p>I think you have to assume that end-users will always be careless. We see this in almost every security setting.

Deep learning is a specific type of machine learning, focusing on higher order statistics. Big data is a term from business not academia, but deals with the unique challenges of machine learning with very big data sets. Fuzzy logic was the fashionable way of dealing with uncertainty before Bayesian logic came to the front (particular flavour of probability). Probability and fuzzy logic should be considered notation.<p>So what\u2019s the difference between probability and logic?<p><i></i><i>Not</i><i></i> Not much. There are lots of types of logic, Bayesian probability can be considered a type of logic. Most people when they think of logic they think of propositional logic, boolean algebra, predicate calculus, formal methods etc. That kind of logic is a billion miles away from probability in culture and the kind of things you can conclude from its application. Logic is rigid truths, undecidability. Probability is a representation of uncertainty and half truths, from which you hope to extract the most likely explanation from partial or noisy data. Formal logic is next to useless on noisy data. Probability is a good fit for noisy problems (like perception).<p>Logic is classic AI. Probability is Modern AI.

The tighter your observe/act loop the more chances to win you have in any given timeframe. Computers can act a heck of a lot faster than humans. Computers can also do a better job for balancing risk than humans in many situations.<p>If I was a consultant I would definitely be selling my report generating ability.

I'm still waiting to hear just what nuts people want turned, especially those for which 'big data' is essential.<p>It's easy enough to find cases where analysis has been stopped due to far too little data or far to little ability to handle more data.  A classic example is R. Bellman's \"curse of dimensionality\" especially for his work in dynamic programming -- i.e., best decision making over time under uncertainty (with flavor quite different from the uses of dynamic programming in some computer science algorithms).<p>Broadly, for the curse of dimensionality, we can start with the set of real numbers R, a positive integer n, and the real n-dimensional space R^n, that is, just the set of all  n-tuples of real numbers.  Then as n starts to grow, it takes 'big data' to start to 'fill', say, the n-dimensional 'cube' with each side 100 units long, [0, 100]^n.  So, if want to describe something in such a cube and want a lot of accuracy, then can start with 1 MB of data and start multiplying by factors of 1000 over and over.  We can zip past a warehouse full of 4 TB disk drives in a big hurry.<p>Here is a general situation in 'analysis':  We are looking for the value of some variable Y.  Since we don't know Y, we can say we are looking for the value of a random variable.  Or we can look for its distribution.  For input, maybe we have many pairs (x, y) where x is in R^n and y is in R.  Then, maybe we are told that in our case we have some X in R^n and want the corresponding Y or its distribution.<p>Well, essentially there is one, just one, one to rule all the rest, way to answer this.  May I have the envelope, please?  Yes, here it is (drum roll):  Simple, plain old cross-tabulation.  Why?  Because cross tabulation is just the discrete version of the joint distribution from which we use the classic Radon-Nikodym theorem (Rudin, 'Real and Complex Analysis') to say that the best answer we can get (non-linear least squares) is just the conditional distribution or its expectation the conditional expectation, that is, E[Y|X] which is the best non-linear least squares approximation of Y as a function of X, and taking an average from a cross tabulation is the discrete approximation of this.  For a good approximation for a lot of values of X, we can suck up 'big data' and ask for many factors of thousands of times more.  The conditional distribution of Y given X is P(Y &#60;= y|X) and is addressed similarly.  So, net, I agree that there can be some good uses for big data.<p>Still, before proposing an answer and picking the tools, let's hear the real questions.  Okay?<p>Why?  For one, as general as cross tabulation is, it commonly requires so much data that even realistic versions of 'big data' are way too small.  So, typically we use methods other than just cross tabulation to make better use of our limited TBs of data, and to select such methods we really need to hear the question first.<p>Before I select a wrench, I want to look at the nut.  Is this point too much to ask in the discussion of 'big data'?<p>I will end with one more:  Suppose we want to estimate E[Y] by taking an average of n 'samples'.  Under the usual assumptions, the standard deviation of our estimate goes down like 1 over the square root of n.  So, to get the standard deviation 10 times smaller, we need n to be 100 times bigger.  So, roughly for each additional significant digit we want in the estimate, we need another 100 times as much data.  Once we start asking for more than, say, five more significant digits, we are way up on a parabola in the amount of data we need.  Net, if we want really accurate estimates, then even big data has to struggle.  So, really, we accept the law of diminishing returns and just use medium or small data.", "parent": 5323292.0, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": null, "id": 5323523, "ranking": null, "date": 1362471483000, "year": 2013}, {"by": "qxf2", "score": null, "time": 1362474244, "timestamp": 1362474244000, "title": "", "type": "comment", "url": "", "text": "&#62;&#62;\"The problem of big data has been solved.

An old paper that looks at this stuff from an economics/finance perspective is here:<p><a href=\"http://weber.ucsd.edu/~hwhite/pub_files/hwcv-077.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://weber.ucsd.edu/~hwhite/pub_files/hwcv-077.pdf</a><p>and there's been a lot of research since then.<p>I suspect that the popularity and faddish nature of \"big data\" right now comes from hope that those automation procedures will make it conceptually easier to do data analysis, but I don't really know if it will (and I have some doubts).<p>[1] I am not a big-data person, so anyone more knowledgeable should jump in and correct me.", "parent": 5326251.0, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": null, "id": 5326425, "ranking": null, "date": 1362508920000, "year": 2013}, {"by": "Niknak03", "score": 1.0, "time": 1362510812, "timestamp": 1362510812000, "title": "Java Developer ( Big Data)", "type": "story", "url": "http://bit.ly/13bkedn", "text": "Identified ( Data Analytics start-up)  is seeking a Java Developer who has a strong interest in data Analytics.\nPlease contact me at Nikki@identified.com", "parent": null, "deleted": null, "dead": true, "descendants": -1.0, "id": 5326630, "ranking": null, "date": 1362510812000, "year": 2013}, {"by": "BigDataStartups", "score": 1.0, "time": 1362520512, "timestamp": 1362520512000, "title": "Big Data to lead the way in the travel industry", "type": "story", "url": "http://www.bigdata-startups.com/big-data-lead-travel-industry/", "text": "", "parent": null, "deleted": null, "dead": true, "descendants": -1.0, "id": 5327617, "ranking": null, "date": 1362520512000, "year": 2013}, {"by": "promptcloud", "score": 2.0, "time": 1362577464, "timestamp": 1362577464000, "title": "What enterprises do with Big Data- Part 2", "type": "story", "url": "http://blog.promptcloud.com/2013/03/what-enterprises-do-with-big-data-part-2.html", "text": "", "parent": null, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": 0.0, "id": 5331074, "ranking": null, "date": 1362577464000, "year": 2013}, {"by": "jobsxp", "score": 1.0, "time": 1362579393, "timestamp": 1362579393000, "title": "BigData Top100: A Big Data Benchmark", "type": "story", "url": "http://nosql.mypopescu.com/post/44607291235/bigdata-top100-a-big-data-benchmark", "text": "", "parent": null, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": 0.0, "id": 5331205, "ranking": null, "date": 1362579393000, "year": 2013}, {"by": "jseliger", "score": 3.0, "time": 1362603703, "timestamp": 1362603703000, "title": "Big Data in the Big Apple", "type": "story", "url": "http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/future_tense/2013/03/big_data_excerpt_how_mike_flowers_revolutionized_new_york_s_building_inspections.single.html", "text": "", "parent": null, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": 0.0, "id": 5333888, "ranking": null, "date": 1362603703000, "year": 2013}, {"by": "citizenkeys", "score": 2.0, "time": 1362645839, "timestamp": 1362645839000, "title": "Big Data is Big Business", "type": "story", "url": "http://ycuniverse.com/big-data-is-big-business", "text": "", "parent": null, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": 0.0, "id": 5336761, "ranking": null, "date": 1362645839000, "year": 2013}, {"by": "Libertatea", "score": 5.0, "time": 1362646187, "timestamp": 1362646187000, "title": "The 'Big Data' Revolution: How Number Crunchers Can Predict Our Lives", "type": "story", "url": "http://www.npr.org/2013/03/07/173176488/the-big-data-revolution-how-number-crunchers-can-predict-our-lives?ft=1&f=1019#.UThUoRAfCm4.hackernews", "text": "", "parent": null, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": 1.0, "id": 5336777, "ranking": null, "date": 1362646187000, "year": 2013}, {"by": "lnmx", "score": 1.0, "time": 1362667462, "timestamp": 1362667462000, "title": "You don\u2019t have a Big Data problem.", "type": "story", "url": "http://www.brentozar.com/archive/2013/03/you-dont-have-a-big-data-problem/", "text": "", "parent": null, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": 1.0, "id": 5337800, "ranking": null, "date": 1362667462000, "year": 2013}, {"by": "thatcherclay", "score": null, "time": 1362667812, "timestamp": 1362667812000, "title": "", "type": "comment", "url": "", "text": "Could not agree with parts of this more - in particular, companies that think about bringing on data scientists to extract value from their \"big data\" would often be better off investigating whether they have the right architecture in place to do that well.

To give you credit, I don't know what issues Quantopian addresses. On the other hand, has any one tried running Zipline-backtested strategies in real life? Does any one know what issues aren't addressed by Quantopian? Corp actions was one part, T-cost model was hinted at in the slides, but was any though given to borrow costs and availability? There leaks everywhere. It is not that you don't seem like smart guys who made this cool thing freely generously available to everyone, but that you seem like you spent too little time downtown NYC.<p>PS. Fully adjusted bars are nice, but they have an epoch to be adjusted to. Unfortunately having an epoch that is not today() means you can't add today's data to it. If you can't add today's data to it, you can use this system to generate real trades to trade. Now you need two sets of data and two sets of code to work with.

It was built as a side effort to support the desktop software we were selling as the main line of business.<p>Since we were running on a single desktop, it never occurred to us to think about large server clusters cranking away on data day and night. We just had to make it work on a regular 'ol single machine. Since user experience is paramount in user-facing desktop software, it meant clever algorithms and performant code to get it to process the data in a timely fashion.<p>One day, one of our customers found themselves incredibly dissatisfied with the money and manpower that was being poured into a \"big-data\" data processing solution on another project, 3 FTEs and a half-dozen very expensive servers.<p>On a lark he asked us if our data processing tool could do what their big-data system was doing. As it turned out, functionality-wise, we were about 80% there. With a couple months worth of work we were 95% there. The big question was performance.<p>The customer setup a single instance of our single desktop data processing software and kicked it off. A few days later it had finished. \"It's not fast enough\" he said. So we spent a few months making it faster and getting rid of bottlenecks. We got it down to just a few hours. \"It's not fast enough!\" he said again.<p>So we halved the time...but that was it, it was pretty much all the performance we were ever going to get out of our code-base. We asked \"how long does your big data system take to do what we're doing in a morning?\", fully expecting that their multi-million dollar solution was cranking through the same data in a ten minutes to a half hour or so.<p>He responded, \"two and a half weeks\".<p>A year later, the other solutions provider called us up and asked us if we were interested in purchasing their big-data processing division. We politely declined.<p>The point is that sometimes the giant software stacks and interconnected clustering systems we build to tackle \"big data\" sometimes introduce <i>so</i> much overhead into the system that a single system, running some smart software <i>can</i> outperform the larger systems.

In terms of storage, it's on the order of a couple hundred terabytes for all our data.

We envision a world where math is free and one does not have to choose between Big Data or Better Algorithms - get them both.<p>(answering some of the comments)<p>- One of our goals is to continue to be extensible and easy to use. H2O is extensible today via, JSON, R (&#38; Python) or via simple java (see package hex) The core platform is very scalable and fast - Thanks again to an amazing team of devoted hackers.<p>- We are inspired by prior art and lessons from Mahout &#38; efforts from RHIPE (Thanks, Saptarshi!) and think of ourselves as the next generation fulfilling the promise with a one simple stack for ML &#38; Math on Bigdata that is open, useful and production grade (performance &#38; testing)<p>- We also believe that great math systems can be built by great systems engineers surrounded by great math people and domain experts (Also, by starting with the end user experience especially one for Big Data Science.) Our team reflects some of that thinking. We welcome data analysts, scientists, math people, distributed systems engineers and domain experts to use, critique and extend our product.<p>- Data ingest into our system can be via SQL, NoSQL, HDFS and plain old filesystem.

There&#x27;s no architectural maximal Mill, but there are diminishing returns; in current process technology we feel that eight ALUs are getting close to that edge, but those decisions are made independently for each market and process.<p>Ivan", "parent": 6139923.0, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": null, "id": 6144745, "ranking": null, "date": 1375404931000, "year": 2013}, {"by": "e2e4", "score": 5.0, "time": 1375582029, "timestamp": 1375582029000, "title": "The Age Of Big Data - BBC Documentary (video)", "type": "story", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzlwhP5JejA", "text": "The BBC documentary follows people who mine Big Data, including LAPD police officers who use data to predict crime, a London scientist&#x2F;trader who makes millions with math, and a South African astronomer who wants to catalogs the entire cosmos.", "parent": null, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": 0.0, "id": 6154272, "ranking": null, "date": 1375582029000, "year": 2013}, {"by": "e2e4", "score": null, "time": 1375582052, "timestamp": 1375582052000, "title": "", "type": "comment", "url": "", "text": "The BBC documentary follows people who mine Big Data, including LAPD police officers who use data to predict crime, a London scientist&#x2F;trader who makes millions with math, and a South African astronomer who wants to catalogs the entire cosmos.<p>via: <a href=\"http://www.kdnuggets.com/2013/08/bbc-documentary-age-of-big-data.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kdnuggets.com&#x2F;2013&#x2F;08&#x2F;bbc-documentary-age-of-big-...</a>", "parent": 6154272.0, "deleted": null, "dead": true, "descendants": null, "id": 6154275, "ranking": null, "date": 1375582052000, "year": 2013}, {"by": "cdvonstinkpot", "score": 1.0, "time": 1375599819, "timestamp": 1375599819000, "title": "How big data will impact advertising (video)", "type": "story", "url": "http://www.bigdata-startups.com/BigData-startup/big-data-impact-advertising-video/", "text": "", "parent": null, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": 0.0, "id": 6154935, "ranking": null, "date": 1375599819000, "year": 2013}, {"by": "datascientist3", "score": 2.0, "time": 1375635196, "timestamp": 1375635196000, "title": "Big Data and Advertising: In the trenches", "type": "story", "url": "http://strata.oreilly.com/2013/08/big-data-and-advertising.html", "text": "", "parent": null, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": 0.0, "id": 6156132, "ranking": null, "date": 1375635196000, "year": 2013}, {"by": "swarnim", "score": 2.0, "time": 1375660697, "timestamp": 1375660697000, "title": "Simplifying Big Data with toons", "type": "story", "url": "http://techytoons.blogspot.com/", "text": "", "parent": null, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": 0.0, "id": 6157620, "ranking": null, "date": 1375660697000, "year": 2013}, {"by": "BigDataStartups", "score": 0.0, "time": 1375696390, "timestamp": 1375696390000, "title": "Why big data matters - video", "type": "story", "url": "http://www.bigdata-startups.com/BigData-startup/big-data-matters-video/", "text": "", "parent": null, "deleted": null, "dead": true, "descendants": -1.0, "id": 6159228, "ranking": null, "date": 1375696390000, "year": 2013}, {"by": "ychakiris", "score": 1.0, "time": 1375719167, "timestamp": 1375719167000, "title": "Saving MS", "type": "story", "url": "", "text": "Cloud based computing has eroded MS in several ways: a) one can live without MS desktop solutions; b) most of the software that runs the cloud based solutions uses open source software.<p>Here is a challenge.

This is a combination of database knowledge (SQL &amp; others), scripting (python &amp; others) and statistical programming (R &amp; others).\n- Statistics:  What does the data mean?  What can you infer?  What can&#x27;t you infer?\n- Domain knowledge:  What are the needs of a consumer products company?  Or telecom company?  Or financial services company.<p>A &quot;Big Data&quot; person needs all three.  Most computational science programs focus mostly on the first, only a little on the second, and not at all on the third.  I&#x27;d argue that academic programs should go heavier on the stats, as that&#x27;s the field that will change the least, and will be the hardest to learn later.

Then we expose all that data, and of our analytics capabilities (e.g. queries), by REST API. You can log into Keen IO and create a line chart, then copy and paste the javascript right into your site. Now you can build a completely white-labeled website for your dentists, while we take care of storing and querying your event data. Our scoped API keys will allow you to secure the data so a given dentist can only see data for her offices. You can also create an internal dashboard for your team so you&#x27;ll able to do analysis across all the dentists. Hopefully you&#x27;ll discover industry trends and benchmarks that you can use in marketing reports or to resell to the dental industry (assuming your dentists allow this!).

From written tutorials, to screencasts, to interactive sites with REPL style code challenges. Looking at sites these course based sites like codeacademy, codeschool, khanacademy, udacity and coursera, I am struggling to find a well rounded course in interacting with databases. \nMy current development position has helped my get around document driven databases and full text search engines, however, it has given me little relational database skills.\nWhat would HN recommend I do? In order to strengthen my confidence with integrating with relational databases and SQL. The aim is to be both well rounded as a full stack developer and more employable. \nI can understand the argument that I just have to get building these things myself.

In Big Data, there are three touchstone applications that the current generation of platforms largely do poorly: real-time, geospatial, graph. Spark does not really address any of these. It might be more accurate to say that Spark is the &quot;next big thing&quot; in the <i>Hadoop</i> universe but still retains many of the same limitations on expressiveness, thereby creating opportunities for a more general Next Big Thing in Big Data.<p>Specifically, &quot;faster batch + in-memory&quot; is basically a simple patch on the batch mode problem but does not really address continuous flow real-time models. At large scales it is quite difficult to get robustly efficient behavior out of a parallel system that is batching things on 5 second intervals if the data flow is anything but trivial.<p>For geospatial and graph analysis, Spark appears to retain the same limitation of Hadoop in that it cannot deal with data models and operations without an <i>a priori</i> optimal partitioning function. Static hash and range partitioning won&#x27;t cut it, particularly if the streaming data sources are actually real-time. The ability to generate uniform partitioning of complex data models with inherently unpredictable data distributions is critical to parallelizing some important analysis types but there is no obvious support for such mechanisms in Spark.<p>One could look at Spark as Hadoop done right, more or less.", "parent": 7088902.0, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": null, "id": 7091973, "ranking": null, "date": 1390254508000, "year": 2014}, {"by": "conollyfreya", "score": 1.0, "time": 1390270669, "timestamp": 1390270669000, "title": "Deep Blue Group Networks auf Deep Blue Stars", "type": "story", "url": "http://www.db-n.com/de/presse/deepblue-stars", "text": "&quot;Our star shines for you&quot; \u2013 deepblue pr\u00e4sentiert &quot;big data&quot; in weihnachtlichem Gewand<p>Deepblue Networks verkn\u00fcpft sein traditionelles Dankesch\u00f6n an die engsten Kunden in diesem Jahr mit einer sch\u00f6nen Botschaft an die eigene Belegschaft: &quot;Jeder von euch ist einzigartig.

Most websites, from social networks to global email providers, have to deal with the traffic generated by their own users, at their own pace, browsing from page to page. However, in the online ad business, doing real-time bidding for ad impressions, we are part of a much larger share of traffic. We see the majority of bid requests for online ads generated globally and we have to respond to them within milliseconds. At peak times, our request rate is measured in millions of events per second. We store and synchronize our collected information globally within a fraction of a second. We process it using machine learning techniques to increase the accuracy of our bid decisions.<p>Our runtime group, responsible for developing software for our real-time bid response systems, is looking for talented undergraduate and graduate students willing to join us for summer projects.

"&lt;sarcasm&gt; Thanks for reading the blog post &lt;&#x2F;sarcasm&gt;<p>I&#x27;m not arguing in &quot;Change for change&#x27;s sake&quot; What I&#x27;m saying is that when banks were conceived they had a simplistic and singular purpose (keeping physical money there because it was not practical to keep it all at your own house)<p>The reason I think we should be seeking a fundamental change in banking is that we&#x27;re not literally having to store gold(or even that much cash) in bank vaults these days.<p>Most money is moved in a non-material sense(which is why the reference to data)<p>&quot;Why? Because so-called big data is &quot;in&quot;?&quot; No. Because moving money is moving data, and simply put the information that allows you to move money lives online, it IS data. The kinds of things that can be stolen or leaked from any provider can allow almost anyone to spend your money like its theirs and they don&#x27;t have to walk into a retail bank to do it.<p>This is why banks are fundamentally data problems at this point.<p>So while I appreciate your opinion I would relegate your opinion to banking not being broken back to a pre-2007 world where smartphones did not exist.<p>Was communication broken? YES Did people not realize it?

Some companies&#x27; data science teams are doing work that could be done in Excel, and others are doing sophisticated machine learning research. In many companies, though, it&#x27;s a watered-down version of the (extinct, sadly) R&amp;D job description. I&#x27;ve heard people opine that 95% of &quot;data scientists&quot; have never implemented anything more sophisticated than an SGD regression, and it wouldn&#x27;t surprise me.<p>Granted, you can get some neat insights and visualizations with off-the-shelf tools, but I still consider it important to know how the algorithms actually work and what the basic assumptions are. For example, you can <i>usually</i> use linear regression for 2-class classification problems (as opposed to the mathematically more correct logistic model, since probabilities are in [0, 1] and linear models diverge at the boundary) get a reasonable predictive model, but it&#x27;s worth knowing when (and why) that short-cut breaks down.<p>In software, you hear &quot;data scientist syndrome&quot; used to describe people who have a lot of short job tenures because they (a) leave if there isn&#x27;t interesting work for them, and (b) tend to be the first laid off, not because they&#x27;re bad but because R&amp;D is first to bleed when things go bad. The software industry forces you to choose between short-term job security (people doing interesting work are most exposed to organizational changes) and long-term career health (people <i>not</i> doing interesting work turn into dinosaurs). It stands to reason that the selection process for organizational credibility (favoring tenure) would be something other than deep knowledge of data science (which requires a stream of interesting work, and the behavioral correlates such as job volatility).<p>It&#x27;s sad that the typical corporate culture of reliable mediocrity, at the expense of excellence, has also learned to use the vocabulary of &quot;Big Data&quot;. Reality: truly Big Data (&gt; 10 TB) is a huge pain in the ass.

Within academic bioscience, I think there is great consensus on what Big Data is - I have not seen much argument at all; however, it is still very hard to define within that field.  The best I can do, over this cup of coffee, is to state that there is a clear distinction between the study of a gene, up to a few pathways vs. computational analysis of multiple OMICS (genomics, metabolomics and proteomics) datasets.  I know that definition is terribly lacking and I am fighting the urge to delete it for the sake of getting the post completed.  Anyway, Big Data is clearly changing the academic biosciences through the funding trend.  That is, grants with a computational focus, or sub focus, certainly seem to be doing comparably well.  I mention this because todays academic funding trends influence the direction of tomorrows startups as those being trained are disproportionally within the better funded labs, and draw upon their previous experience when forming companies.  So, I personally believe this Big Data thing, however it is best defined over all, or within a given field, is in some way something new, and will continue to shape the startup sphere for years to come, especially in the areas of genomics, metabolomics and proteomics.

Nowhere does the original article make the statement that Google used an &quot;unbelievably complex model that no one could ever understand&quot;, or that we had <i>no</i> understanding of why GFT worked (merely that the assumptions were not made explicit).<p>What it <i>did</i> say though was that &quot;Big Data practitioners&quot; (whatever that means) too often tend to make the mistake of ignoring threats to external validity [1] because dealing with big datasets gives researchers a false sense of confidence in the assumption that &quot;N = all&quot;. This is a very valid point and IMHO the most important takeaway of the original article, but it is not addressed here.<p>On a side note, I feel the pothole example (where using a mobile app to crowdsource pothole detection in Boston unknowingly led to a bias towards younger and more affluent areas) would have been more relevant towards discussing that thesis than focusing on the details of GFT.<p>What Tim Harford (the author of said article) denounces is the recent trend that sees people claiming Big Data is &quot;the end of theory&quot; [2], where traditional theories and hypothesis testing are being replaced by theory-free procedures such as validating metrics against a hold-out set. The problem is that while previously the relative scarcity of data lead social science researchers to carefully consider their data sources, the abundance of passively generated data we have now tends to cause them to forget to do their due diligence when assessing the threats to the external validity of their findings. Normally such concerns naturally arise when you&#x27;re deciding on your data collection methodology or your experiment design, but Big Data analyses do tend to be different in that they focus much more on finding latent relationships in existing raw data. This also increases the risk to unknowingly fall prey to the multiple comparisons problem [3], which is the other important point Harford touches on but isn&#x27;t really addressed in this post.<p>In that respect, yes, Big Data analyses can be more prone to this kind of problem. Even if you dismiss it as a case of bad scientists and not bad science, it remains that the general population is much more prone to overly trust findings that came out of such analyses, and articles such as Harford&#x27;s are important to remind both practitioners and laypeople to be careful.<p>[1] <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_validity\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;External_validity</a><p>[2] <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2012/mar/09/big-data-theory\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;datablog&#x2F;2012&#x2F;mar&#x2F;09&#x2F;big-dat...</a><p>[3] <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_comparisons_problem\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Multiple_comparisons_problem</a>", "parent": 7500131.0, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": null, "id": 7500387, "ranking": null, "date": 1396256191000, "year": 2014}, {"by": "crayola", "score": null, "time": 1396257870, "timestamp": 1396257870000, "title": "", "type": "comment", "url": "", "text": "&quot;I suggest that \u2018Big Data\u2019 analyses are no more prone to this kind of problem than any other kind of analysis.&quot;<p>To an extent, large data volumes make it more difficult for the statistician to be as nimble.

Nevertheless, a resource that would explain the differences between various NoSQL solutions, what kind of problems those solutions solve and best practices to adopt NoSQL is still missing. AboutNoSQL.com is filling this void.<p>We at Thumbtack Technology believe that NoSQL has a great potential in solving some of the most challenging problems faced by companies today, including big data processing and machine learning. Through this site we want to educate our visitors about benefits and applications of NoSQL and help them with achieving their goals by using this exciting technology.<p>We are excited for your visit.

I have worked in this area since 1998. So here are a few thoughts:<p>- Good analytics (I&#x27;ll combine the three terms into &#x27;analytics&#x27; for the sake of simplicity) requires an understanding of the tools, as well as a significant understanding of statistics so that you know which analysis to pick. But in addition, it requires a lot of creativity (see my examples below) and a significant amount of time to analyze&#x2F;slice&#x2F;dice data in a zillion different ways.<p>- This is a huge opportunity. Much, much bigger than people realize and much bigger than past trends of new technologies like client-server in early nineties or web apps of 4-5 years back. Why? Because it has the power to affect business processes very powerfully.<p>- Example 1: I spent 10 months working for a $5B shipping company analyzing data from their Marketing department. I combined it with several hundred global data sources. I worked on over 100 hypotheses. At the end of it, I came up three specific actions that their existing customers take about 6 months before going to a competitor. The Marketing department was thrilled. They spent $17 Million coming with a plan to tackle this. It has been a few months since then; and they have not lost a single customer. This is a powerful proprietary competitive weapon for them now.<p>- Example 2: I analyzed 10 years of power meter reading data for a large utility company. I combined it publicly available data sources of power consumption of major appliances and census data on family composition&#x2F;wealth for various neighborhoods. I was able to reliably predict the lifestyle of every family, down to whether the person living in the house streamed a movie on Friday evenings and a whole lot more. So the company decided to use this analysis to change their Direct Mailers with very specific, personalized offerings. Their response to the first test mailer sent to 10,000 people? Twenty seven percent!!!

Let alone importable, custom, extensions to SQL, or embedding lazy functions within the data structure.<p>* Intent vs Exact. The ability to describe partial intent, rather than exactly how to organize, the data (e.g. describing the operations expected to be executed across it, rather than the indexes to build). As well as having information available from the compiler about how the data structure is used (so that without the explicit declarations, the intent can still be optimized for).<p>SQL is a fine direction to approach the big picture problem from, but it isn&#x27;t anywhere near the goal I care about.

One thing that is new and big about Big Data is the market. It should be called &quot;Big Market (of data)&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s an overloaded term. IMHO it&#x27;s counterproductive to let the hype around Big Data as a business term pollute the discussion about what contribution Google and others have made in the field of computer science and data processing.<p>So what did Google really invent? Obviously the name and concept behind MapReduce wasn&#x27;t new. Nor the fact that they did start to process large amounts of data.<p>Size and growth are two key factors here. Although it&#x27;s possible that the NIH syndrome affected Google, it&#x27;s possible that existing products just weren&#x27;t able to solve those two requirements. It&#x27;s difficult to tell exactly how large given that the Google is not very keen at releasing numbers, although it&#x27;s possible to find some announcements like [1] &quot;Google processed about 24 petabytes of data per day in 2009&quot;.<p>20P is 10000 times more that 200 T. Stop to think a moment what does 10000 mean.\nIt&#x27;s enough to completely change the problem, almost any problem. A room full of people becomes a metropolis; an US annual low wage salary becomes 100 million dollars, more than the annual spending of Palau [2]. Well, it&#x27;s silly to make those comparison, but it&#x27;s hard to think about anything that scaled by 10000 doesn&#x27;t change profoundly.\nHell, this absurdly long post is well under 10k!<p>To stay in the realm of computer science, processor performance didn&#x27;t increase by a factor of 10000 since PDP-11 from 1978 to Xeon from 2005 [3].<p>Working at that scale poses unique problems, and that&#x27;s where real the contributions\nto the advancement of the field made by the engineers and the engineering culture at Google are placed. If anything, just knowing it&#x27;s possible\nand having some accounts on what they focused on is inspiring.<p>This is the Big Data I care about. It&#x27;s not about fanboyism. It&#x27;s cool, it&#x27;s real, it&#x27;s rare. Arguing who invented the map reduce mechanics is like arguing that hierarchical filesystems where already there hence any progress made in that area by countless engineers is just trivial.<p>[0] Historical perspective: James Gleick , <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Information:_A_History,_a_Theory,_a_Flood\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;The_Information:_A_History,_a_T...</a><p>[1] <a href=\"http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=1327452.1327492\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;dl.acm.org&#x2F;citation.cfm?doid=1327452.1327492</a><p>[2] <a href=\"https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ps.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cia.gov&#x2F;library&#x2F;publications&#x2F;the-world-factbook&#x2F;...</a><p>[3] <a href=\"http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~sedwards/classes/2012/3827-spring/advanced-arch-2011.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cs.columbia.edu&#x2F;~sedwards&#x2F;classes&#x2F;2012&#x2F;3827-sprin...</a>", "parent": 7957479.0, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": null, "id": 7974037, "ranking": null, "date": 1404256031000, "year": 2014}, {"by": "BigDataStartups", "score": 1.0, "time": 1404313569, "timestamp": 1404313569000, "title": "Moving From What Big Data Is, To What Big Data Can Do", "type": "story", "url": "http://www.bigdata-startups.com/moving-from-what-big-data-is-what-big-data-can-do/", "text": "", "parent": null, "deleted": null, "dead": true, "descendants": null, "id": 7977368, "ranking": null, "date": 1404313569000, "year": 2014}, {"by": "teekert", "score": 1.0, "time": 1404336219, "timestamp": 1404336219000, "title": "Ask HN: Big Data / Machine learning books for biologists?", "type": "story", "url": "", "text": "Dear HN,\nI have a Ph.D. in Biophysics and am currently working at a large international health care&#x2F;research company.

If you see a word, technology or concept on HN that you don&#x27;t know about, spend 30 seconds googling it. Usually, 30 seconds is enough to get a basic idea of what it is about.  The more you do this, the more you will be able to relate things to each other, and you&#x27;ll be able to intuit a lot of context from just a single-line description of something.<p>Don&#x27;t try to learn a lot of languages.  When you&#x27;re 17, it&#x27;s useless to know VB, C++, PHP, C#, Lisp, swift, dart, python AND ruby.  Pick one you now know and like, and stick to it for a while.  Become a genuinely good coder in one language, and you&#x27;ll be able to pick up another in no time.  Knowing one language really well also teaches you loads of the basic concepts that you can use to understand other technologies.

cleanly solve this problem in the near future.<p>1.

You would think that I can get reasonably clean data every day, or failing that, being able to automate the data cleaning script. Nope!

If the data is small enough, humans can correct them fairly reliably, especially with some help from automation scripts&#x2F;software. That said, doing this at scale is a very hard problem. One thing I learned working at a big data company is that many folks use MapReduce as a data cleanser at scale, and for that, MapReduce is a pretty awkward tool.<p>3.

Technically I do okay ; not the super coder kind of good but not noob as well. Lately, I am feeling torn between multiple choices that I have to go from here.<p>1.  I have studied engineering in the past. I would like to go for MBA. However, it is becoming very hard to land job. I am confident that I can land at least in top 25 school in US.  Doing MBA mean I will put 2 years more in study ; will empty 30k I have accumulated so far and will be in debt for around another 80k.\nEven after that finding decent paying job going to be major challenge.<p>2.  Getting job ( or even reply ) is increasingly getting difficult. I completed project management certification from reputed university but employer doesn&#x27;t seem to care.  My current job pays okay but nothing great to expect there.  Plus, it is increasingly becoming dull day by day. I am yet to learn Hadoop and related big data technologies.  By realistic expectation learning these technologies is going to take time.<p>3. I have couple of ideas for startup but United States law does not allow to start business on visa. Going back to India and working on startup is altogether different story ( won&#x27;t go in much detail but been lived for 25 years I can tell you that it will be x100 times difficult than in US ). \nNot sure what to do at this point.

The naive approach (start at a &quot;random&quot; weight setting, use gradient descent) that works on a convex error surface fails catastrophically on deep, complex neural nets. (Shallow neural net training is a non-convex problem as well, but seems to be &quot;less non-convex&quot; in practice.) In the past 10 years, people have become better at getting past that.<p>Theoretically, only one hidden layer is necessary for neural nets to be universal. Thus, for a long time, most research focused on single-layer networks because those were &quot;good enough&quot; to model any mathematical function. The problem is that convergence, for single-layer nets, can be very slow (especially given that you&#x27;re often doing <i>stochastic</i> gradient descent when working large data sets). Single-layer nets are often very difficult to audit. There&#x27;s a lot of &quot;cross talk&quot; where unrelated features are mapped to the same &quot;space&quot; in the network. So you have a &quot;black box&quot; that is hard to interpret.<p>Deep neural nets (which is what ML researchers call &quot;deep learning&quot;, until MBAs start abusing the latter term, as they have with &quot;big data&quot;) have come back into style over the past few years, due to recent research into how to make them actually perform, and findings about superior convergence with the right conditions. In deep nets, there&#x27;s often a problem of signals either amplifying or vanishing as they propagate throughout the net. The former leads to saturation (the neural net moves very slowly from a suboptimal but flat place on the error surface) and the latter is too linear and unlikely to pick up interesting features. Even now, making deep neural nets <i>not</i> sensitive to initial starting conditions is an unsolved problem, but there&#x27;s been a lot of progress.<p>I would hazard the guess that the convolutional technique is a lot more useful in deep neural networks than it is in single-hidden-layer neural nets.", "parent": 8293850.0, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": null, "id": 8294372, "ranking": null, "date": 1410311697000, "year": 2014}, {"by": "kmavm", "score": null, "time": 1410326285, "timestamp": 1410326285000, "title": "", "type": "comment", "url": "", "text": "Hi, I am a research engineer in Yann LeCun&#x27;s group at Facebook.

(Shallow neural net training is a non-convex problem as well, but seems to be &quot;less non-convex&quot; in practice.)<p>Starting at a random (no scare quotes needed) point in weight space and SGD&#x27;ing is exactly what Alex Krizhevsky, and all of the derivative convnets over the last two years, did and do. It works just fine; I sit at work doing it all day long. You need to have enough data to train on, big enough models, and enough flops to train the big models on the big data before your interns&#x27; grandchildren die. We have all of the above now. Aside: even single-layer neural networks do not have convex error surfaces; convexity, and funky error surface geometry, is not a relevant distinction between shallow and deep nets. There have been no magical optimization breakthroughs, it&#x27;s still SGD with the same herbs and spices that were used in the 90&#x27;s (momentum, e.g.).<p>&gt; The problem is that convergence, for single-layer nets, can be very slow (especially given that you&#x27;re often doing stochastic gradient descent when working large data sets).<p>&quot;Stochastic&quot; gradient descent just means doing lots of weight updates per epoch. Ceteris paribus, training on large, redundant data sets, stochastic converges faster than batch because it gets to consider more points in the weight space than batch per pass over the data. The problem with single-layer neural nets is not that they converge slowly; the problem is that the layer size needs to grow exponentially with the task size. Single-layer neural nets&#x27; universal approximation power is thus not of great practical consequence. The power of deep nets is the power of <i>composition</i>: f(g(h(x))) is a strictly more powerful model than f(x) holding the number of parameters constant.<p>&gt;  Even now, making deep neural nets not sensitive to initial starting conditions is an unsolved problem, but there&#x27;s been a lot of progress.<p>You just initialize with a Gaussian ball around zero and explore whatever valley in the error surface you happen to be in.

I wanted to add file version support to an open-source project, and after some basic research, settled on Git. The catch was that the open-source project ran in a pure-PHP environment (no modules beyond those commonly found on shared hosting). So I had to find a way of reading Git repositories in PHP without resorting to exec() etc. Hence, read-only Git in pure PHP. Throw in WebDAV or SSH and you can actually push &#x2F; pull to those repositories with front-end clients like SparkleShare, which was a good candidate for future work.<p>I nearly went crazy, of course. I had little-to-no understanding of DVCS concepts, graphs, and so on (big O analysis is still difficult to be honest).

Eventually, we have to give real guarantees. Civil engineers eventually learned to build bridges that were guaranteed to stand up. So with big data, it will take decades, I suspect, to get a real engineering approach, so that you can say with some assurance that you are giving out reasonable answers and are quantifying the likelihood of errors.</i><p>It&#x27;s seems like the idea is that machine learning and data driven inference have to grow up and become a real scientific discipline. &quot;Why can&#x27;t you be more like Civil Engineering?&quot; This isn&#x27;t the best way to look at it. Machine learning is designed for situations where data is limited and there are no guarantees. Take Amazon&#x27;s recommendation engine for example. It&#x27;s not possible to peer into someone&#x27;s mind and come up with a mathematical proof that states whether they will like or dislike John Grisham novels. A data driven model can use inference to make predictions based on the person&#x27;s rating history, demographic profile, etc. It&#x27;s true that many machine learning approaches don&#x27;t have the scientific heft of civil engineering, but they are still very useful in many situations.<p>I&#x27;m not disagreeing with the eminence of Michael I. Jordan. I think this is a philosophical question with no correct answer. Is the world <i>deterministic</i>, can we model everything with rigorous physics style equations? Or is it <i>probabilistic</i>, are we always making inferences based on a limited amount of data? Both of those views are valid, especially in different contexts. Some of the most interesting problems are inherently probabilistic, such as predicting the weather, economic trends and the behavior of our own bodies. &quot;Big Data&quot; is obviously a stupid buzzword, but the concept of data driven decision making is very sound. We should put less focus on media hype terms and continue to encourage people to make use of large amounts of information.

Yet we live in a time where we don&#x27;t need a PhD program to receive education from the likes of Ng, LeCun and Langford. We live in a time where curiosity and dedication can net you valuable results. Where CUDA-hackers can beat university teams. The entire field of big data visualization requires innate aptitude and creativity, not so much an expensive PhD program. I suspect Paul Graham, when solving his spam problem with ML, benefited more from his philosophy education than his computer science education.<p>Of course, having a PhD. still shows dedication and talent. But it is no guarantee for practical ML skills, it can even hamper research and results, when too much power is given to theory and reputation is at stake.<p>In my experience Machine Learning was locked up in academics, and even in academics it was subdivided. The idea that &quot;you need to be an ML expert, before you can run an algo&quot; is detrimental to the field, not helping so much in adopting a wider industry use of ML. Those ML experts set the academic benchmarks that amateurs were able to beat by trying out Random Forests and Gradient Boosting.<p>I predict that ML will become part of the IT-stack, as much as databases have. Nowadays, you do not need to be a certified DBA to set up a database. It is helpful and in some cases heavily advisable, but databases now see a much wider adoption by laypeople. This is starting to happen in ML. I think more hobbyists are right now toying with convolutional neural networks, than there are serious researchers in this area. These hobbyists can surely find and contribute valuable practical insights.<p>Tuning parameters is basically a gridsearch. You can bruteforce this. In goes some ranges of parameters, out come the best params found. Fairly easy to explain to a programmer.<p>Adapting existing algorithms is ML researcher territory. That is a few miles above the business people extracting valuable&#x2F;actionable insight from (big or small or tedious) data. Also there is a wide range of big data engineers making it physically possible to have the &quot;necessary&quot; PhD&#x27;s extract value from Big Data.", "parent": 8486191.0, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": null, "id": 8487526, "ranking": null, "date": 1413902125000, "year": 2014}, {"by": "michaelochurch", "score": null, "time": 1413906671, "timestamp": 1413906671000, "title": "", "type": "comment", "url": "", "text": "<i>In my experience it&#x27;s amazing just how many people are talking about &quot;Big Data&quot; and just how exactly none of those are the ones with the necessary PhDs in statistics and algorithms to get anything of any value done.</i><p>The fact that you think it takes a PhD to be a decent data scientist indicates that you&#x27;re out of your depth on this one.<p>You don&#x27;t need a PhD to get useful work done in these fields.

It&#x27;s like dating:  you&#x27;ll encounter (a hell of) a lot of rejection at first, but soon enough you&#x27;ll  find someone who sees the &quot;real you&quot;, and will look past the faults that others can&#x27;t get past.<p>(4) Once you&#x27;ve done that -- everything else will take care of itself.  Time will expand, and, as if by magic, you&#x27;ll find space and energy to work on your big data skills, your github profile, your English, whatever.<p>(5) And BTW, don&#x27;t worry about your English.  It might ding you in interviews (and you should definitely keep working on it), but it&#x27;s really quite good.  And you can take comfort in the fact that 99% of the people born in monolingual English-speaking environments in the U.S. (if that&#x27;s where you are), i.e. the very people dinging you in interviews for your sub-perfect English skills, are themselves total wimps and klutzes at foreign languages, and would basically starve to death if dropped in a non-English environment and no one was willing to take pity on them and help them out despite their being too &quot;lazy&quot; to immediately become natively fluent in the local tongue.", "parent": 8567623.0, "deleted": null, "dead": null,

This analysis requires\n  a skill-set as broad as it is deep: scientists must be \n  experts not only in their own domain, but in statistics, \n  computing, algorithm building, and software design as \n  well. Many researchers are working hard to attain these \n  skills; the problem is that academia&#x27;s reward structure is \n  not well-poised to reward the value of this type of work. \n  In short, time spent developing high-quality reusable \n  software tools translates to less time writing and \n  publishing, which under the current system translates to \n  little hope for academic career advancement.\n</code></pre>\nI think the HN title is somewhat misleading, the central thesis from the original article is stated as:<p><pre><code>  the skills required to be a successful scientific\n  researcher are increasingly indistinguishable from the \n  skills required to be successful in industry\n</code></pre>\nThis is probably a stunningly awesome outcome - it means that industry has a place for advanced degree holders who will not find a classic academic position.  In the linked essay above, from the same author:<p><pre><code>  the number of PhDs granted each year far exceeds the \n  number of academic positions available, so it is simply \n  impossible for every graduate to remain in academia.\n</code></pre>\nI wish people would not use &#x27;big data&#x27; as a label in these discussions.  I think the essential truth is that being able to apply a scientific, quantitative thought process to problems combined with the ability to write software to provide others with solutions to those problems is valuable across academia and industry.

Scala developers in particular are used to modern language idioms and so could relatively easily switch to Rust.", "parent": 8701670.0, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": null, "id": 8702043, "ranking": null, "date": 1417731491000, "year": 2014}, {"by": "myth_drannon", "score": 2.0, "time": 1417739536, "timestamp": 1417739536000, "title": "Introduction to Big Data with Apache Spark \u2013 EdX Course", "type": "story", "url": "https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-big-data-apache-spark-uc-berkeleyx-cs100-1x#.VID8zt9jPkw", "text": "", "parent": null, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": 0.0, "id": 8702525, "ranking": null, "date": 1417739536000, "year": 2014}, {"by": "vijaygirija", "score": 2.0, "time": 1417778910, "timestamp": 1417778910000, "title": "How Customer Data Can Help in Business?

I don&#x27;t seem to be alone here, one slightly old WSJ article points in the same direction [2].<p>My startup would require ~$0.5M to get started, mostly for purchasing expensive machinery, which is a quite modest amount in biotech terms. That&#x27;s partly because a large part of the startup functions would be machine learning-based, which is thankfully a lot cheaper to run than a wet lab.<p>We would be tackling a very general problem, so this amount seems even more modest in perspective. Google got funded with $25M back in &#x27;99 to get past the prototype stage.<p>Understandably, places like YC won&#x27;t go up to that much of initial funding because it doesn&#x27;t fit their model [3]. On the other hand, biotech VCs seem to prefer investing on drug pipelines. My idea is very IT-based, so they seem to dislike going into that alien route. Therefore, I might be stuck between both worlds.<p>Any ideas on who should I approach or possible VCs happy to fund this kind of thing?

Large deep nets will generally be able to learn feature representations by themselves, which makes them extremely powerful for tasks where we aren&#x27;t quite sure of exactly what features we want.<p>However, deep nets require large amounts of training data and computational power. The fairly recent widespread adoption of general purpose GPUs has allowed much faster training. Combine this with the popularity of &quot;big data&quot;, and you&#x27;ve got a perfect storm for deep neural nets.<p>Of course, the hype may be overvaluing deep nets as the future of AI. DNNs work well in practical applications, but they&#x27;re poorly defined theoretically and the AI community suspects that we&#x27;re still bad at training them -- a recent paper showed that a simpler shallow net can perform as well as a deep net if a deep net is trained first[1]. We&#x27;re also fairly certain that deep nets are not how the brain actually works, and thus we&#x27;ll need a different architecture in order to achieve human level performance on some tasks.<p>[1] <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6184\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;1312.6184</a>", "parent": 8890259.0, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": null, "id": 8890306, "ranking": null, "date": 1421284125000, "year": 2015}, {"by": "jeremynixon", "score": 3.0, "time": 1421346899, "timestamp": 1421346899000, "title": "63 Machine Learning, Data Science, Big Data Resources and Articles", "type": "story", "url": "http://www.datasciencecentral.com/profiles/blogs/new-selection-of-40-machine-learning-big-data-ressources-and", "text": "", "parent": null, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": 0.0, "id": 8894397, "ranking": null, "date": 1421346899000, "year": 2015}, {"by": "jraedisch", "score": 1.0, "time": 1421394811, "timestamp": 1421394811000, "title": "You too can collect big data!

In this case it looks like a single node is faster. However, it&#x27;s not <i>better</i> for the original original task, which was to experiment with learning Hadoop. (&quot;I was skeptical of using Hadoop for the task, but I can understand his goal of learning and having fun with mrjob and EMR.&quot;) As the original original spec no longer exists, I cannot tell if fault-tolerance was one of them. As it was a personal learning project, no doubt it wasn&#x27;t.<p>So this new essay is adding details that weren&#x27;t relevant to the original task, then complaining that the details weren&#x27;t addressed. This is poor form.<p>You ask &quot;how can you say when you need one, ten or 100&quot; and the easy answer is to go ahead and implement it on one node. If it takes an hour to write a single node solution would take, and it&#x27;s fast enough for your foreseeable needs, then you&#x27;re a lot better off than spending a day to try out a Hadoop solution. Plus, without the single node solution it&#x27;s hard to know if you have a good baseline.", "parent": 8919155.0, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": null, "id": 8919885, "ranking": null, "date": 1421790633000, "year": 2015}, {"by": "BigDataStartups", "score": 1.0, "time": 1421831342, "timestamp": 1421831342000, "title": "The Role Ontology Plays in Big Data", "type": "story", "url": "https://datafloq.com/read/role-ontology-plays-big-data/749", "text": "", "parent": null, "deleted": null, "dead": true, "descendants": null, "id": 8922198, "ranking": null, "date": 1421831342000, "year": 2015}, {"by": "support_ribbons", "score": 2.0, "time": 1421837845, "timestamp": 1421837845000, "title": "Easily run Dataflow Big Data pipelines anywhere, thanks to Cloudera", "type": "story", "url": "http://googlecloudplatform.blogspot.com/2015/01/easily-run-dataflow-big-data-pipelines-anywhere-thanks-to-cloudera.html", "text": "", "parent": null, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": 0.0, "id": 8922474, "ranking": null, "date": 1421837845000, "year": 2015}, {"by": "andyjpb", "score": null, "time": 1421845954, "timestamp": 1421845954000, "title": "", "type": "comment", "url": "", "text": "This is a great article and a fun read. A friend sent it over to me and I wrote him some notes about my thoughts. Having since realised it&#x27;s on HN, I thought I&#x27;d post them here as well.<p>Some of my wording is a bit terse; sorry! :-) The article is great and I really enjoyed it. He&#x27;s certainly got the right solution for the particular task at hand (which I think is his entire point) but he&#x27;s generally right for the wrong reasons so I pick a few holes in that: I&#x27;m not trying to be mean. :-)<p>-----\nClassic system sizing problem!<p>1.75GiB will fit in the page cache on any machine with &gt;2GiB RAM.<p>One of the big problems is that people really don&#x27;t know what to expect\nso they don&#x27;t realise that their performance is orders of magnitude\nlower than it &quot;should&quot; be.<p>Part of this is because the numbers involved are <i>really</i> large:\n1,879,048,192 bytes (1.7GiB) is an incomprehensibly large number.\n2,600,000,000 times per second (2.6GHz) is an incomprehensibly large\nnumber of things that can be done in the blink of an eye.<p>...But if you divide them using simple units analysis; things per second\ndivided by things gives you seconds: 1.383. That&#x27;s assuming that you can\nprocess 1 byte per clock cycle which might be reasonable if the data is\nsmall and fits in cache. If we&#x27;re going to be doing things in streaming\nmode then we&#x27;ll be limited by memory bandwidth, not clock speed.<p><a href=\"http://www.techspot.com/review/266-value-cpu-roundup/page5.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.techspot.com&#x2F;review&#x2F;266-value-cpu-roundup&#x2F;page5.h...</a>\nreckons that the Intel Core 2 Duo E7500 @ 2.93GHz) has 7,634MiB&#x2F;s of\nmemory bandwidth for reads.<p>That&#x27;s 8,004,829,184 bytes per second.<p>Which means we should be able to squeeze our data through the processor\nin...<p>bytes per second divided by bytes = seconds =&gt;<p>&gt;&gt;&gt; 8004829184 &#x2F;  1879048192.0\n4.260044642857143<p>so less than 5 seconds.<p>We probably want to assume that there are other stalls and overheads,\nbut a number between 20 and 60 seconds seems reasonable for that\nworkload (he gets 12): the article says it&#x27;s just a summary plus\naggregate workload so we don&#x27;t really need to allocate much in the way\nof arithmetic power.<p>As with most things in x86, memory bandwidth is usually the bottleneck.\nIf you&#x27;re not getting numbers with an order of magnitude or so of memory\nbandwidth then either you have a arithmetic workload (and you know it)\nor you have a crap tool.<p>Due to the memory fetch patterns and latencies on x86, it&#x27;s often\npossible to reorder your data access to get a nominal arithmetic\nworkload close to the memory bandwidth expected speed.<p>His analysis about the parallelisation of the workload due to shell\ncommands is incorrect. The speedup comes from accessing the stuff\nstraight from the page cache.<p>His analysis about loading the data into memory on Hadoop is incorrect.\nThe slowdown in Hadoop probably comes from memory copying, allocation\nand GC involved in transforming the raw data from the page cache into\nobject in the language that Hadoop is written in and then throwing them\naway again. That&#x27;s just a guess because you <i>want</i> memory to fill up (to\nabout 1.75GiB) so that you don&#x27;t have to go to disk. That memory is held\nby the OS rather than the userland apps tho&#x27;.<p>His conclusion about how `sleep 3 | echo &quot;Hello&quot;` is done is incorrect.\nThey&#x27;re &quot;done at the same time&quot; because sleep closes stdout immediately\nrather than at the end of the three seconds. With a tool like uniq or\nsort it has to ingest all the data before it can begin because that&#x27;s\nthe nature of the algorithm. A tool like cat will give you line-by-line\nflow because it can but the pipeline is strictly serial in nature and\n(as with uniq or sort), might stall in certain places.<p>He claims that the processing is &quot;non-IO-bound&quot; but also encourages the\nuser to clear the page cache. Clearing the page cache <i>forces</i> the\nworkload to be IO bound by definition. The page cache is there to &quot;hide&quot;\nthe IO bottlenecks where possible. If you&#x27;re doing a few different\ncalculations using a few different pipelines then you <i>want</i> the page\ncache to remain full as it will mean that the data doesn&#x27;t have to be\nreread from disk for each pipeline invocation.<p>For example, when I ingest photos from my CF card, I use &quot;cp&quot; to get the\ndata from the card to my local disk. The card is 8GiB. I have 16GiB of\nRAM. That cp usually reads ahead almost the whole card and then\nbottlenecks on the write part of getting it onto disk. That data then\nsits in RAM for as long as it can (until the memory is needed by\nsomething else) which is good because after the &quot;cp&quot; I invoke md5sum to\ncalculate some checksums of all the files. This is CPU bound and runs\nway faster than it would if it was IO bound due to having to reread all\nthat data from disk. (My arrangement is still suboptimal but this gives\nan example of how I can get advantages from the architecture without\nhaving to do early optimisations in my app: my ingest script is &quot;fast\nenough&quot; and I can just about afford to do the md5sum later because I can\nbe almost certain it&#x27;s going to use the exact same data that was read\nfrom the card rather than the copied data that is reread from disk and,\ntheoretically, might read differently.)<p>He&#x27;s firmly in the realm of &quot;small data&quot; by 4 or 5 base 10 orders of\nmagnitude (at least) so he&#x27;s nowhere close to getting a &quot;scaling curve&quot;\nthat will tell him where best to optimise for the general case. When he\nstarts getting to workloads 2 or 3 orders of magnitude bigger than what\nhe&#x27;s doing he might find that there are a certain class of optimisations\nthat present themselves but that probably won&#x27;t be the &quot;big data&quot;\ngeneral case.<p>Having said that, this makes his approach entirely appropriate for the particular task at hand (which I think it his entire point).<p>Through his use of xargs he implies (but does not directly acknowledge)\nthat he realises this is a so-called &quot;embarrassingly parallel&quot; problem.\n-----", "parent": 8909176.0, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": null, "id": 8922889, "ranking": null, "date": 1421845954000, "year": 2015}, {"by": "tonysandhu3", "score": 1.0, "time": 1421867170, "timestamp": 1421867170000, "title": "What Is Big Data?

In past experience (Google), there were all sorts of problems that working with <i>actual</i> huge data sets introduced that wasn&#x27;t handled by the frameworks available (not even MapReduce, which by most accounts is significantly more advanced than Hadoop).  Things like:<p>1. With a big data set, there is no easy way to verify the correctness of your algorithms.  The data is too big to hand inspect, and so assuming your code is syntactically well-formed and doesn&#x27;t crash, you will get an answer.  Is your answer correct?  Well, you don&#x27;t actually know, and any number of logic errors might throw it off without causing a detectable programming error.<p>2. Big data is messy.  There will be some records in your data set that are formatted differently than you expect, or contain data that means something semantically different than you expect.  Best case, your Hadoop job crashes 4 hours in.  Worst case, it silently succeeds, and you have no idea that your results were polluted by spurious results that you had no idea existed.<p>3. Big data will expose basically every code path and combination of code paths in your analysis program, so it all better be bulletproof.  Learn how to write code correctly the first time, or you&#x27;re going to be spending a lot of time waiting for the script to run and then fixing crashes several hours in.<p>4. Big data contains outliers.  Oftentimes, the outliers will dominate your results, and so if you don&#x27;t have a way of filtering them out or making your algorithm less sensitive to them, you will get garbage as your final answer.<p>There are techniques to deal with these, but they are techniques that are built into your workflow as a data scientist, and <i>not</i> the tools that are available.

I don&#x27;t think folks here disagree with the &quot;true&quot; part. Let me explain why it is &quot;sadly&quot; and &quot;for now&quot;.<p>The biggest issue with big data is most of it sits unused. In many organizations, HDFS ends up being an alternative to NetApp storage servers, storing terabytes of data with the hopes of them being useful one day.<p>In fact, if you already get to that stage of using HDFS as a storage server, you must have a decent ETL team that can put data into HDFS with a menacing combination of ad hoc scripts and a workflow that looks like a cobweb produced by a deranged spider. For now, knowing the ins and outs of various semi-functional open source components and the tenacity, patience and skill to deal with the gnarliest of ETL tasks get you a high-paying data engineering job.<p>But, in the long term, there will be a big change.<p>1. Tools are getting better: many data practitioners are realizing there are huge gaps between different data infrastructure components, and they are trying to fill these gaps. There is a lot of attention given to query execution engines (Presto, Impala, Spark, etc.) but I find data collection&#x2F;workflow management tools are just as critical (if not higher leverage) right now. Tools like Fluentd (log collector) [1], Luigi (workflow engine) are OSS software in this direction.<p>2. Data-related cloud services are becoming really, really good: huge kudos to services like AWS, GCP, Heroku (through Addons). They are quickly building a great ecosystem of data processing&#x2F;analysis&#x2F;database components that frankly work better than most self-administered OSS counterparts. (Disclaimer: my perception might be colored here since I work for a data processing&#x2F;collaboration SaaS myself [3])<p>So, back to the question. I think aspiring data engineers have two distinct career paths:<p>1. Becoming an expert in a particular data engineering component: this would be building a query execution engine, designing a distributed stream processing system, etc. (It would be awesome if you decide to release as open source)<p>2. Becoming an expert on quickly and effectively deploying cloud services to get the job done: this is the skill most desired among data engineers at startups.<p>What not to become is one of these OSS DIY bigots: not good enough to build truly differentiating technology, but adamant about building and running their own &lt;up and coming OSS technology&gt;.

In my experience &quot;big data&quot; is all in the eye of the beholder, and it&#x27;s not all about how many gigabytes of data you work with, how wide, or how long it is. The challenges are the same: how to use the data in relevant ways to forward organizational goals. In my case the days isn&#x27;t particularly long in terms of number of rows, but it is exceptionally wide in terms of potential variables. It&#x27;s enough data that I have to spend a reasonable amount of time thinking about the most efficient way to model (statistically) and data mine. The issues are similar to other data oriented jobs I&#x27;ve had: how to determine which variables are relevant, clean and transform the data... And ultimately how to turn a big pile of data into a model which effectively predicts likelihood of charge off if the loan were to be approved. Scintillating stuff, but obscenely difficult. Of course, it&#x27;s harder too because I&#x27;m the only modeler and am fairly inexperienced. My last experience building predictive models was a couple classes in college...

In class in college we used &quot;canned&quot; data sets which were already cleaned, validated, organized, and so forth. This made it unrealistically easy to model. In the real world just working with the data effectively is a hard won skill. So from the get go you need to learn how to explore data, visualize it, interpret plots and statistics, clean&#x2F;transform&#x2F;normalize it, formulate a question your data can answer, and apply the relevant methods in pursuit of the answers you seek. Once you have the fundamentals down the size of the data is immaterial--only requiring you to put additional thought into what you can computationally achieve (for instance, how to determine which of 150 candidate variables are statistically relevant).", "parent": 8939328.0, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": null, "id": 8942138, "ranking": null, "date": 1422163573000, "year": 2015}, {"by": "bobosha", "score": null, "time": 1422165333, "timestamp": 1422165333000, "title": "", "type": "comment", "url": "", "text": "Perhaps the biggest of big data problems - imagery (photos &amp; video) We build algorithms to extract value in imagery.", "parent": 8939328.0, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": null, "id": 8942177, "ranking": null, "date": 1422165333000, "year": 2015}, {"by": "biomimic", "score": 3.0, "time": 1422209272, "timestamp": 1422209272000, "title": "AI = (Steven Pinker + Michael Jordan) / Limits in Computation", "type": "story", "url": "", "text": "It would be awe-inspiring to see an inter-disciplinary approach to solving a portion of AI via Machine Learning (Micheal Jordan) and based on mimicking a portion of human cognition via &quot;How the Mind Works&quot; (Steven Pinker).<p>Machine-Learning Maestro Michael Jordan on the Delusions of Big Data and Other Huge Engineering Efforts:<p>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;spectrum.ieee.org&#x2F;robotics&#x2F;artificial-intelligence&#x2F;machinelearning-maestro-michael-jordan-on-the-delusions-of-big-data-and-other-huge-engineering-efforts<p>Steven Pinker on How the Mind Works:<p>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;How_the_Mind_Works<p>I think this is the only way we are going to make real progress on the AI front.", "parent": null, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": 0.0, "id": 8943626, "ranking": null, "date": 1422209272000, "year": 2015}, {"by": "tonysandhu3", "score": 1.0, "time": 1422253407, "timestamp": 1422253407000, "title": "4 Unstoppable Essentials for Big Data for Startups", "type": "story", "url": "http://www.narmis.ca/Blog/Post/466/4-Unstoppable-Essentials-For-Big-Data-For-Startups", "text": "", "parent": null, "deleted": null, "dead": true, "descendants": null, "id": 8945767, "ranking": null, "date": 1422253407000, "year": 2015}, {"by": "ifcologne", "score": 2.0, "time": 1422261986, "timestamp": 1422261986000, "title": "We need the engagement platform for translating big data learning", "type": "story", "url": "http://paul4innovating.com/2015/01/25/we-need-the-engagement-platform-for-translating-big-data-learning/", "text": "", "parent": null, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": 0.0, "id": 8946063, "ranking": null, "date": 1422261986000, "year": 2015}, {"by": "alanctgardner3", "score": null, "time": 1422281421, "timestamp": 1422281421000, "title": "", "type": "comment", "url": "", "text": "There&#x27;s a lot of stuff under the &quot;Big Data&quot; umbrella: I focused on Hadoop below because that&#x27;s my focus right now. I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m missing some roles here, but the specialities I can think of are:<p>- getting data out of production systems and transforming it (infrastructure or ETL)\n- analytical querying and reporting\n- system administration\n- machine learning<p>There&#x27;s also the wide world of NoSQL data stores, which people lump in with big data, but which require vastly different skills.<p>The Hadoop VM I linked to above is good for working through exercises for all of the above.<p>As a starting point, this book[1] walks through the motivation behind Hadoop, and then gets a little into internals and use cases. It&#x27;s out of date, but you can work through it and get into the right frame of mind, understand HDFS, etc. It&#x27;s a good starting point.<p>AMP Camp (that I linked to above) is an introduction to Spark for people with a little Hadoop experience. Spark is getting a lot of attention, you could run into it in a number of roles.<p>If you&#x27;re going to be planning the whole pipeline, or doing any sort of infrastructure role, I recommend Hadoop Application Architecture[2] for more modern tools and design patterns. This blog post[3] is a pretty good overview of distributed logs, which are essential for horizontal scale. Understanding Kafka and ZooKeeper is really useful for infrastructure roles, maybe less so for admins.<p>If you&#x27;re planning to be in the reporting layer, having a deep understanding of SQL and data warehousing is useful. This book[4] is old hat, but I would say it&#x27;s expected knowledge for anyone planning a warehouse, and it&#x27;s interesting to understand best practices. Most places will also expect knowledge of Tableau or a similar BI tool, but that&#x27;s tougher to learn on your own since licenses are brutal. Visualization with D3 is nice to have in this space, especially if you&#x27;re coming from a web background - Scott Murray&#x27;s tutorials [5] are a good starting place.<p>It&#x27;s harder to point to resources for sysadmins - if you weren&#x27;t a sysadmin before, you need to understand a lot of other concepts before you worry about Hadoop stuff. ML is similar -  you need to understand the principles and be able to work on a single node. There&#x27;s lots of good resources out there about getting started in data science.<p>1. <a href=\"http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920021773.do\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;shop.oreilly.com&#x2F;product&#x2F;0636920021773.do</a><p>2. <a href=\"http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920033196.do\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;shop.oreilly.com&#x2F;product&#x2F;0636920033196.do</a><p>3. <a href=\"http://engineering.linkedin.com/distributed-systems/log-what-every-software-engineer-should-know-about-real-time-datas-unifying\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;engineering.linkedin.com&#x2F;distributed-systems&#x2F;log-what...</a><p>4. <a href=\"http://ca.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0471200247.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;ca.wiley.com&#x2F;WileyCDA&#x2F;WileyTitle&#x2F;productCd-0471200247...</a><p>5. <a href=\"http://alignedleft.com/tutorials\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;alignedleft.com&#x2F;tutorials</a>", "parent": 8939819.0, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": null, "id": 8947038, "ranking": null, "date": 1422281421000, "year": 2015}, {"by": "alanctgardner3", "score": null, "time": 1422283504, "timestamp": 1422283504000, "title": "", "type": "comment", "url": "", "text": "&gt; The biggest issue with big data is most of it sits unused<p>This is really variable. If you&#x27;re at a place where they jumped on the bandwagon, then yes. There are also lots of companies (and not just Google&#x2F;FB&#x2F;LinkedIn) that build mission critical reporting and ML infratstructure on Hadoop. These companies appreciate the value of workflow coordination, and they wouldn&#x27;t move ahead without (at least) Oozie&#x2F;Azkaban in place to give some visibility into their workflow.<p>&gt; But, in the long term, there will be a big change.<p>I think more types of work will become commoditized. If you just want log processing, there are lots of on-premises and cloud options. Splunk has been doing this forever. Ostensibly with good-enough BI software you could just focus on ingest, and everything else is drag and drop. On a long enough time frame, hand-rolling pipelines will become obsolete. This is like a 10+ year timeline for any player to get significant market share. In the meantime, people have to actually get stuff done, and their skills will be transferable because they understand distributed systems, ETL, warehousing, and a lot of other stuff that hasn&#x27;t really changed in a decade.<p>&gt; Becoming an expert in a particular data engineering component<p>Are you advocating that nobody writes Spark Streaming jobs, because they should rewrite Spark instead? Don&#x27;t learn to work with Impala, learn to rewrite Impala? I disagree, the tools are only getting better, and it&#x27;s going to take more and more work to replace the entrenched players.  Working on top of solid tools will make you far more productive than engaging in NIH and making your own SQL engine.<p>&gt; Becoming an expert on quickly and effectively deploying cloud services to get the job done<p>Like RedShift, EMR and Amazon Data Pipeline? They&#x27;re hardly turn-key solutions. Amazon&#x27;s Kinesis is just Kafka with paid throughput - you can absolutely re-use your skills in the cloud, without having to cave and get locked in to a single vendor serving one specific use-case.<p>&gt; What not to become is one of these OSS DIY bigots: not good enough to build truly differentiating technology, but adamant about building and running their own &lt;up and coming OSS technology&gt;<p>So in your mind you either pick a vendor to handle all your data for you, or you&#x27;re an &quot;OSS DIY bigot&quot;?

There are a lot of people that want to do this type of computing and a lot of them hate Java.<p>JVM != Java. It runs a wide variety of languages, and this is not just theory - you can do Spark in Python right now. &quot;Every language I care about&quot; was perhaps overly flippant, but between Groovy, Clojure and Scala there&#x27;s something to suit most programming tastes.<p>Meanwhile I hate Linux, and Docker doesn&#x27;t have a good answer for that; the suggestions I&#x27;ve seen for developing with Docker on other platforms boil down to &quot;run Linux in a VM&quot;.<p>&gt; Could you give an example of what could go wrong here? Docker prevents you from talking to the outside world so you can&#x27;t call out to an outside service in the middle of a job or anything like that.<p>I&#x27;m more worried about forward compatibility, standardization - and partly attack surface I guess. I can run jars from 15 years ago, on today&#x27;s JVM - and not because it bundles an old version; I can link today&#x27;s programs against 15-year-old libraries and they&#x27;ll just work. If a library I built against has disappeared from the internet, that&#x27;s fine.<p>Meanwhile I can&#x27;t run linux binaries from 15 years ago (I did try with some of the loki games - maybe it&#x27;s possible but it&#x27;s decidedly nontrivial). Even if I found the right .sos, if I wanted to use a library with the ABI of ten years ago in my program, I&#x27;d have to rebuild the whole world. I guess I&#x27;m meant to rebuild my docker image, but that doesn&#x27;t work if the library source is no longer available, and I&#x27;m not at all confident that the tooling does fully reproducible builds to the same extent as e.g. maven (from what I can see plenty of dockerfiles use unpinned versions).<p>Finally, the spec for the JVM is in one place, and it&#x27;s published; apache harmony shows that a ground-up reimplementation is possible (that the TCK isn&#x27;t open is very unfortunate, but the patents will expire sooner or later). I have a reasonable level of confidence that we&#x27;ll always be able to run the jars we&#x27;re producing today, without having to emulate x86s or what have you. Linux doesn&#x27;t have a spec like that (yes the C code is available), and I don&#x27;t think a ground-up reimplementation would be feasible.<p>&gt; In Pachyderm job scheduling happens outside the user submitted containers. The job scheduler is what actually spins up the containers and pushes data through them. I&#x27;m afraid I don&#x27;t understand what it would even mean for one of those containers to then do job scheduling itself.<p>Job scheduling was a poor example; I guess I&#x27;m thinking more things like e.g. running your own database on the cluster nodes, instead of talking to one outside the cluster via a proper interface. (Admittedly that&#x27;s possible on hadoop with derby or h2).<p>Thinking about it more I guess it&#x27;s less the service part and more the interface part that I&#x27;m worried about.

Once you have a WalMart or an Uber, it helps them operate better. It does not have the ability to create the next WalMart or Uber.<p>That means that Big Data, as it is now, will always be able to continue to optimize within a limited system, but will not be able to see outside of that system. Big Data will not be able to create the next paradigm-changing thing like Uber, because paradigm-changing things are by definition outside the scope of the data already collected.<p>Recently there was a a study published by some MIT students about startups. It ran a bunch of numbers and gave you advice: pick a small name, operate outside the valley, use older workers, and so on. But as somebody pointed out, you really need to have a great idea, spot-on execution, and market traction. If you have that, the rest of it doesn&#x27;t matter. More to the point, if you have all of those things the MIT guys came up with, they&#x27;re not going to give you the other things you need. As it turns out, the things you need for a great startup are still fiercely debated -- hence the MIT study in the first place. Correlation does not equal causation.<p>I see this in big companies all of the time. Our projects are running, on average, 100% late! So somebody looks at the data and finds that most of the time is spent testing. What do we need? Better testers, of course!<p>Simply because you can point to a couple of different things that track together does not mean you understand anything.

I get it.  I do not blame you, and I do appreciate your honesty and good amount of technical detail.  I just get tired of this general tact, by no means your specific words, that tracking is inevitable you cannot stop it.  We have made this culture, and I for one want it gone.  I will not people just accept in a public, specifically HN, if I have energy to oppose it.<p>&gt;The ad networks do care about this since it&#x27;s still lost revenue, but our effect is minimized because we often have much bigger reach than just a few sites and can still serve plenty of ads across the entire web. There is an arms race and the big companies just pay to play. Remember the adblock plugins are usually made by for-profit corporations who will grant exceptions for cash so take from that what you will.<p>Touche.  I had since moved away from the obvious culprits (AdBlock in all variants, disconnect.me) and only use uBlock when I have to allow all through NoScript, as I need content off a website that only renders text content with many CDN&#x27;s and junk enabled (not all former are the latter, but there is overlap).  Now, I can tell default whitelist from NoScript is bought off, so I remove a lot of it from the beginning and set more aggressive defaults by browsing a few comments sites and turning everything off beyond what is necessary.  So I am well aware of that, and try to stick to what I think is right, not trusting adblockers primarily, but NoScript and redirecting many malicious ad and bot networks to my hosts file on my local computer and running a blank webpage.  As others have noted, my browsing performance is better and my experience cleaner.<p>I know by virtue of your interest you do not have that scummy level of ad that necessitates my use of these things, but how can I know to trust you over thousands of companies without auditing all of you?<p>&gt; As for privacy, I have to ask first, what are you trying to accomplish? Remember you can either have accurate ads best fit for you or have complete privacy. We can&#x27;t show you stuff that&#x27;s relevant without tracking, that&#x27;s just reality. I can&#x27;t reveal too much but networks usually start tracking with cookies and some more advanced methods by themselves but as they get bigger, we outsource a lot of the tracking to 3rd party companies who are very good at this. There are lots of browser and device fingerprinting technologies and other information that you give off just to visit and render a site that we can use. Even the internet carriers themselves participate in this and you can&#x27;t really hide from them since most people just have 1 connection. Proxy services will help but again you&#x27;re sacrificing a lot of convenience and speed for what? To stick it to us? Unless you&#x27;re running adblockers, we&#x27;ll just end up serving you generic ads anyway and still tracking as best we can.<p>I want security and my internet profile, even anonymized, used to facilitate garbage I do not approve of.  To be honest, I am sure your company products are not who I am worried about.  But I think I have to not run interactive content using any form of code you send to my machine without express authorization because most self-respecting computer enthusiasts no what that means.  Now if only ad distributors and web apps had centralized repos of JS content, even obfuscated, signed from a central repository that browsers could turn and off like yum&#x2F;apt&#x2F;zypper repos, I would been in love (yes, I know this is a joke and pipe dream).<p>I know some clients of your industry feel strongly about this, and prevent me from viewing any page without JS, for ads and otherwise.  There is a balance, and I will walk it.  But as an IT tech of approaching 10 years, I trust no dynamic content in the browser unless I can load the page without it first.  Even I have potentially infected my computer according to work IDS tools.  Me, and you can see unlike 98% of our userbase, I actually care and pay attention.  You better be damn sure I can read text, or it must be a very legit site for <i>my</i> purposes (Github, Reddit, I even disable HN bc they are one of a handful sites I use without JS ever enabled, I loved you for it HN).  I wish it was altruism, but it is really functionality.  I can handle ads, within reason.  But should my belief that potentially malicious hot-loaded content is a concern I am not willing to fight for in court?  I have plenty of broken computers in my office to attest to that.<p>&gt; I think there&#x27;s a massive misconception on what exactly you&#x27;re protecting yourself from. Most user profiles are removed after 15-30-60 days as it becomes stale. We don&#x27;t collect personally identifying information (but facebook does), we don&#x27;t track searches (but google does), and it&#x27;s all just anonymized identifiers. Beyond that, we can always just ask the big data collecting agencies for more information to make a decision without actually collecting&#x2F;storing anything ourselves (stuff like purchase histories) so you&#x27;re not giving up much there either. I do understand the battle for privacy but in lots of situations, the issues are overblown if you want my honest opinion.<p>I think yes, I owe you a concession.  But I want to be clear, the big fish in this giant ocean are destroying the tolerance we have for operations like yourself: small-pond fish trying to make it big.  I do not trust the FB, Google, or Social Anything.  I try to browse Google search results with static HTML if possible (now using DDG HTML only results more often, or using it as a Google proxy with !g redirect on queries), I hardly ever enable the CDNs or ajaxapis.g.c utility servers on pages on less absolutely necessary since we know they probably store such data in diagnostic logs for decades to come, legal or extra-legally.<p>In the age of secret warrants, why do I need to give you the benefit of the doubt?  I mean, your industry, will all due respect, sells market items; it does not cure cancer.  At a philosophical level (I know this is not where your appeal comes from), why should I trust you?  Other people I trust less than you will petition you for your much larger competitor&#x27;s data and build a public internet profile of what I am up to.  What will stop you from ending up in their dragnet 5-10 years from now?<p>Keep in mind I live in the Arab World.  I am no prude, but even AdWords, for personal and work computers I see daily on many sites, show giant billboard sidebar ads saying Meet Qatari Singles (in of itself hilarious) with women with large breasts and generous cleavage.  I see this even on computers with veiled women working at them.  Even I find this messed up.  When people are on my computer, it makes me look like a sketchball.  If I have to quick search sites at someone&#x27;s desk to research a problem I have not seen before and stumble upon this crap, how do I look?  The extremes of the industry bring good eggs like you down, even the most elite of them.  How should I filter you guys?  This is a hard problem.  I ask rhetorically.<p>Now, if you write an industry rag shame practices and starting to list good example&#x2F;bad example companies, I wouldl love to read it, as I will know how selective I should be with my filtering.

Challenges include analysis, capture, curation, search, sharing, storage, transfer, visualization, and information privacy. The term often refers simply to the use of predictive analytics or other certain advanced methods to extract value from data, and seldom to a particular size of data set.<p>See the last term? That&#x27;s the meaning used in this article. You can see that in &quot;Mistake #1&quot; when it mentions Python Pandas. That expects that data can fit into RAM. You can see more of it in &quot;10s of gigabytes of data, the power of a scripting languange [sic] like Python, no matter how optimized, may not be enough&quot; -- I used Python to process 10s of GB of data, and renting a 60 GiB machine from Amazon costs $1.680&#x2F;hour.<p>If you believe that it&#x27;s not &quot;Big Data&quot; unless you need a cluster of machines to have enough RAM to work with it, then I can well understand why you might complain about Python in this context.<p>On the flip side, I&#x27;ve seen, or heard of, &quot;Big Data&quot; projects which start with the expectation that it will require a cluster, and never investigate if &#x27;traditional data processing applications&#x27; are adequate. Eg, in one project I developed optimizations that gave an overall 40x performance boost, so that one machine was needed when previously my client required a cluster.<p>If Big Data includes using machine learning to identify patterns in data sets too large to understand by people, then we were using Python to do data mining of large chemical screening data in the late 1990s. Even earlier, Python was being used to control supercomputing tasks, where the high-level glue code was in Python and the low-level code in C or Fortran.<p>Unlike simple map-reduce jobs, these included codes with complex inter-node dependencies, like molecular dynamics, where the network bandwidth is another important performance factor. A molecular dynamics simulation can product 10s of GB per day, so can easily count as &quot;Big Data&quot; projects which cannot be done using the JVM-based solutions you mentioned.<p><a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.infoq.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;2014&#x2F;01&#x2F;bigdata-languages\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.infoq.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;2014&#x2F;01&#x2F;bigdata-languages</a> also gives a viewpoint on the lack of importance of the specific language on big data analysis.", "parent": 9320733.0, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": null, "id": 9321871, "ranking": null, "date": 1428175353000, "year": 2015}, {"by": "hemapani", "score": 1.0, "time": 1428244109, "timestamp": 1428244109000, "title": "10 things statistics taught us about big data analysis", "type": "story", "url": "http://www.kdnuggets.com/2015/02/10-things-statistics-big-data-analysis.html", "text": "", "parent": null, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": 0.0, "id": 9324104, "ranking": null, "date": 1428244109000, "year": 2015}, {"by": "mtuncer", "score": 1.0, "time": 1428302920, "timestamp": 1428302920000, "title": "Ten examples of IoT and big data working well together", "type": "story", "url": "http://www.zdnet.com/article/ten-examples-of-iot-and-big-data-working-well-together/", "text": "", "parent": null, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": 0.0, "id": 9326932, "ranking": null, "date": 1428302920000, "year": 2015}, {"by": "ddispaltro", "score": 4.0, "time": 1428335826, "timestamp": 1428335826000, "title": "Gearpump \u2013\u00a0A lightweight real-time big data streaming engine", "type": "story", "url": "http://www.gearpump.io/site/", "text": "", "parent": null, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": 0.0, "id": 9328756, "ranking": null, "date": 1428335826000, "year": 2015}, {"by": "tonysandhu3", "score": 1.0, "time": 1428346130, "timestamp": 1428346130000, "title": "9 Easy Ways to Succeed Using Big Data", "type": "story", "url": "http://www.narmis.ca/Blog/Post/905/9-Easy-Ways-to-Succeed-using-Big-Data", "text": "", "parent": null, "deleted": null, "dead": true, "descendants": null, "id": 9329929, "ranking": null, "date": 1428346130000, "year": 2015}, {"by": "rmarcelozano", "score": 1.0, "time": 1428376164, "timestamp": 1428376164000, "title": "Como dar la bienvenida a Big Data en su compa\u00f1\u00eda", "type": "story", "url": "http://vintegris.info/big-data-10101/", "text": "", "parent": null, "deleted": null, "dead": true, "descendants": null, "id": 9331820, "ranking": null, "date": 1428376164000, "year": 2015}, {"by": "tuxlinuxien", "score": 1.0, "time": 1428376364, "timestamp": 1428376364000, "title": "Ask HN: Which NoSQL solution should I use for lot of upserts?", "type": "story", "url": "", "text": "I am actually working on a big data project and I am using SSDB.\nThe problem is, it doesn&#x27;t support clustering and sharding so I might have to implement it by myself; which is not the best solution I think.<p>I mostly have to deal with floats or integers and the schema change really often so key&#x2F;value storage is really suitable for my project but I can&#x27;t store data into RAM because I generate 20GB of data per day (with 100K write&#x2F;upserts per seconds).<p>Is there anyone of you who is using a persistent key&#x2F;value storage in production environment, which can support clustering and sharding?

The real problems of our world though are not usually due to an individual but the emergent behavior of our over populated communities. Can we apply deep learning to solve these issues? For example, can deep learning predict who will become a terrorist? We may have a big enough sample size to train such a neural net if we throw in all the biographies of the Guantanamo inmates and those at other facilities.

My job in itself isn&#x27;t bad, I got good colleagues, I get to work pretty much on what I want.  The pay isn&#x27;t that great on the other hand and I have the feeling that I reached all I can reach within the company.  I&#x27;m also tired of being an executor.  I believe I have both intellectual capacity and skills necessary to give leadership and manage and evolve a product.  I recently turned 36 and feel like I&#x27;m nowhere near where I should be.  I&#x27;m also in a small country with no tech industry worth mentioning so jobs that appeal to me are rare.<p>For the past 3 years I&#x27;ve applied for another job outside of this company once a year.  Only when a job opening comes around that really interests me.<p>The first one was for a high tech big data company as a product manager.  The hiring managers loved me and everything looked like it was going my way until last minute an internal candidate applied who eventually got the job.<p>The second year I applied for a job the equivalent of that of my boss at a company in a related niche.  After several rounds of tests and interviews it was down to two candidates and the other one won.

Because we are not from bay area, we are not connected in its inner circle. Friend and family funding is not an option. We are wary of raising seed money until we are sure that our idea has legs. So, we are thinking about doing part-time consultancy work in bay area to bring in enough money to pay the bills. I understand that it will be a distraction but I think it is necessary for us to go through the next 3-6 months. I have read patio11&#x27;s blog but I am not sure how to get some of those high paying consultancy jobs so that it is not a major time sink.\nPersonally I have worked at multiple major cloud companies of today. I have a lots experience in building really large scale systems, how to scale them on public cloud. My co-founder is also a software engineer. If you need someone to read a computer science paper and convert that to code, he is your guy.

&quot;BlueDBM: an appliance for big data analytics&quot;<p>Abstract:<p>&gt;<i>&quot;Complex data queries, because of their need for random\naccesses, have proven to be slow unless all the data can be\naccommodated in DRAM. There are many domains, such as\ngenomics, geological data and daily twitter feeds where the\ndatasets of interest are 5TB to 20 TB. For such a dataset, one\nwould need a cluster with 100 servers, each with 128GB to\n256GBs of DRAM, to accommodate all the data in DRAM.\nOn the other hand, such datasets could be stored easily in the\nflash memory of a rack-sized cluster. Flash storage has much\nbetter random access performance than hard disks, which\nmakes it desirable for analytics workloads. In this paper we\npresent BlueDBM, a new system architecture which has flash-\nbased storage with in-store processing capability and a low-\nlatency high-throughput inter-controller network. We show\nthat BlueDBM outperforms a flash-based system without these\nfeatures by a factor of 10 for some important applications.\nWhile the performance of a ram-cloud system falls sharply\neven if only 5%~10% of the references are to the secondary\nstorage, this sharp performance degradation is not an issue\nin BlueDBM. BlueDBM presents an attractive point in the\ncost-performance trade-off for Big Data analytics.&quot;</i><p><a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;people.csail.mit.edu&#x2F;wjun&#x2F;papers&#x2F;ISCA15_Sang-Woo_Jun.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;people.csail.mit.edu&#x2F;wjun&#x2F;papers&#x2F;ISCA15_Sang-Woo_Jun....</a>", "parent": 9876911.0, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": null, "id": 9876967, "ranking": null, "date": 1436775732000, "year": 2015}, {"by": "rossiben", "score": 1.0, "time": 1436799118, "timestamp": 1436799118000, "title": "Why the editor of the Times kicked News UK\u2019s big data chief out of his office", "type": "story", "url": "http://www.information-age.com/industry/uk-industry/123459824/why-editor-times-kicked-news-uks-big-data-chief-out-his-office", "text": "", "parent": null, "deleted": null, "dead": true, "descendants": null, "id": 9878437, "ranking": null, "date": 1436799118000, "year": 2015}, {"by": "FOSSSquirrel", "score": 1.0, "time": 1436884309, "timestamp": 1436884309000, "title": "An intro to big data", "type": "story", "url": "http://opensource.com/business/15/7/introduction-big-data", "text": "", "parent": null, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": 0.0, "id": 9885134, "ranking": null, "date": 1436884309000, "year": 2015}, {"by": "g_money", "score": 1.0, "time": 1436888959, "timestamp": 1436888959000, "title": "As Big Data Plateaus, DataCamp Raises $1M to Ramp Up Education", "type": "story", "url": "http://www.xconomy.com/boston/2015/07/14/as-big-data-plateaus-datacamp-raises-1m-to-ramp-up-education/", "text": "", "parent": null, "deleted": null, "dead": true, "descendants": null, "id": 9885808, "ranking": null, "date": 1436888959000, "year": 2015}, {"by": "tonysandhu3", "score": 1.0, "time": 1436942707, "timestamp": 1436942707000, "title": "7 Surprising Challenges of Implementing Big Data", "type": "story", "url": "http://www.narmis.ca/Blogs/Post/910/7-Surprising-Challenges-of-Implementing-Big-Data", "text": "", "parent": null, "deleted": null, "dead": true, "descendants": null, "id": 9890039, "ranking": null, "date": 1436942707000, "year": 2015}, {"by": "gaxelrod23", "score": 2.0, "time": 1436979494, "timestamp": 1436979494000, "title": "VTS Raises $21M to Bring Big Data to Commercial Real Estate", "type": "story", "url": "http://techcrunch.com/2015/07/15/vts-raises-21m-to-bring-big-data-to-commercial-real-estate/", "text": "", "parent": null, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": 0.0, "id": 9892458, "ranking": null, "date": 1436979494000, "year": 2015}, {"by": "tonysandhu3", "score": 1.0, "time": 1436988291, "timestamp": 1436988291000, "title": "5 Important Big Data Trends to Watch for in 2015", "type": "story", "url": "http://www.narmis.ca/Blogs/Post/500/5-Important-Big-Data-Trends-to-Watch-for-in-2015", "text": "", "parent": null, "deleted": null, "dead": true, "descendants": null, "id": 9893479, "ranking": null, "date": 1436988291000, "year": 2015}, {"by": "kavehs2", "score": 3.0, "time": 1437007008, "timestamp": 1437007008000, "title": "Can Big Data Save US from the Worst Drought in History?", "type": "story", "url": "https://www.sherbit.io/big-data-water-crisis/", "text": "", "parent": null, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": 0.0, "id": 9894941, "ranking": null, "date": 1437007008000, "year": 2015}, {"by": "yulishap", "score": 4.0, "time": 1437042685, "timestamp": 1437042685000, "title": "Best Movies with Big Data and Machine Learning", "type": "story", "url": "http://blog.dato.com/best-movies-with-big-data-and-machine-learning", "text": "", "parent": null, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": 0.0, "id": 9896356, "ranking": null, "date": 1437042685000, "year": 2015}, {"by": "Citius117", "score": 1.0, "time": 1437047173, "timestamp": 1437047173000, "title": "Ask HN: Recommended resources for someone new to Cloud IT", "type": "story", "url": "", "text": "Hi HN-<p>I&#x27;m a finance major with an interest in the tech space.

So that I could use it for my day to day work after its production release in Christmas.<p>If you liked Perl in the past, and like Ruby. You will absolutely love Perl 6. It has a lot more cleaned up syntax. And the language as such is very Perlish. You will enjoy grammars and macros. And please don&#x27;t think arrival of JSON and XML has solved and eliminated all text processing problems on earth. If anything arrival of any standard format, only emphasizes the importance of good text processing tools. One size fits all approach doesn&#x27;t work for common place problems. Sooner or later you will see people shoe horning all kinds of solutions into problem domains they don&#x27;t belong. The net result looks more like a kludge, than a real solution. This is the whole problem facing people today, because we are forced to use solutions which were not invented to solve the problems they were designed to solve.<p>&gt;&gt;In general we choose a language for their applicability to the problem domain.<p>Perl 6 is a language designed to provide you tools to work with any problem domain, while adopting without breaking backwards compatibility. If this is your concern, then you only have good news to listen.<p>&gt;&gt;As a result it feels much like a solution in search of a problem.<p>iPhone, Unix, C, the original perl itself were all solutions in search of a problem. None of them had prior users or had well marketed audience to begin with. Sometimes people don&#x27;t know what they want unless they are shown the solution. Tools are not designed based on survey results. Else we wouldn&#x27;t have cars today, only faster horse carriages.<p>&gt;&gt;I would look at how dominant Java seems to be in the big data community and try knocking it off that perch with appropriate language primitives, constructs and libraries.<p>Java as a benchmark is worst design point you can start with. Only reason why Java is even surviving today is because of its enterprise inertia, and unlimited supply of cheap programmers. At some point in time a massive reset to Java way of doing things is imminent. Language as a whole is old, the original platform-independent goal is now common place in all tools. They can&#x27;t seem to add anything new or useful without breaking backwards compatibility and the power is falling in the face of newer and powerful languages.", "parent": 10168993.0, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": null, "id": 10171536, "ranking": null, "date": 1441385282000, "year": 2015}, {"by": "threeseed", "score": null, "time": 1441413568, "timestamp": 1441413568000, "title": "", "type": "comment", "url": "", "text": "There is far more aspects to big data than just how much data you store.<p>But regardless you completely missed the point.

While we want this person to have a strong DevOps bent, it would be wrong to call them a DevOps engineer.  Instead, we are looking for people who can contribute to our system from the testing setup to the deployment pipeline to our big data system and even the main product.  While we do our coding in Python and use Docker, AWS, Jenkins, and other tooling we don\u2019t think the tools themselves are the most important part. Instead, we are looking for people who aren\u2019t afraid to experiment with new technologies, build ambitious systems, and invent new ways of doing things.<p>BAMx is a platform to connect publishers and merchants through a real time marketplace, to benefit from the content and not the ads. We are a funded, early stage startup in Manhattan. We have strong customer traction and are looking to build our engineering team.<p>If you joined our team, you would immediately be jumping in and contributing vital pieces to our system.  Amongst other things, we have a fully automated test and deployment pipeline, big data gathering and analytics, comprehensive system monitoring, a real time auction system, and tight integration with numerous customer\u2019s systems.  All of these have great opportunities for improvement and for someone to take ownership and make their mark in this industry.<p>Further, you would be working in a great engineering environment.  We are committed to doing things the right way, testing our code, refactoring it, and taking the time to do things right the first time.  We use the best tools with new MacBook Pros, we have status lights to show the status of our build pipeline, and monitors displaying the current status of our system.  We even have a computerized voice that announces every pull request and a red button that you\u2019ll have to push to see what it does.

Only on numerical computing.<p>No, that&#x27;s not where it is. It&#x27;s in being a user friendly language for people who need to get numerical work done, and there&#x27;s a huge difference. IPython&#x2F;Jupyter did not happen in any other language, not even remotely (the closest thing I&#x27;ve seen is some Lua graphic repl that didn&#x27;t go far).<p>&gt; Nobody wants Python to morph into Java.<p>Python is not morphing into Java, far from it. 3.x represents a cleanup of the language (str vs. unicode, new vs. old style classes, a lot of other stuff). I do not agree with all of it (I too disagree with demoting print from statement to function), and there is other stuff I would have done - but most of it was desperately needed.<p>&gt; What I want is vectorization plus DAG-like workflows. These are the most important pieces of computer science that actually dovetail with real world use cases, today<p>For a tiny, tiny part of the users. And they already have e.g. Theano, and a few other tools, that give some solutions.<p>&gt;  What I&#x27;d really like is for Python to give us a good framework for the Big Data world which is in almost everybody&#x27;s use case now,<p>Excuse me, but I have to disagree anyone other than a tiny (perhaps 1 percent) of Python users care about big data. Most definitely not &quot;everybody&#x27;s use case&quot;. And the minority which actually cares about big data should not get anywhere close to Python - the runtime is prohibitive.<p>&gt; This is not a nice-to-have capability anymore.

I don&#x27;t believe that you are right on this.<p>&gt; Let&#x27;s not gift the opportunity of huge data to Java (Spark) and Cuda, or a new language that will see the future better than us. It should be Python!<p>Check out Nim + Nimborg. You&#x27;ll get the best of Python and Nim, and Nimborg would let you do the transition smoothly.<p>Your idea of Python is not Guido&#x27;s idea of Python, and as far as I know does not have popular support anywhere.

If your software is written in, say, Python you need to either<p>- write a wrapper (an approach taken by Crossbow [1], SeqPig [2], or BioPig [3])<p>- reimplement (an approach taken by CloudBurst [4] or ADAM [5])<p>Reimplementing a whole pipeline represents a huge upfront cost. Writing wrappers is more feasible and, accordingly, a huge amount of custom tailored pipelines and ad-hoc worklfow systems have emerged recently. So if it boils down to wrapping libraries and running them on Hadoop, then we need to make this as easy as somehow possible.

I do business intelligence at Amazon, and I&#x27;ve seen this play out millions of times over. The fetishization of big data ends up meaning that everybody thinks their problem needs big data. After 4 years in a role where I am expected to use big data clusters regularly, I&#x27;ve really only needed it twice. To be fair, in a complex environment with multiple data sources (databases, flat files, excel docs, service logs), ETL can get really absurdly complicated. But that is still no excuse to introduce big data if your data isn&#x27;t actually big.<p>I really hate pat-myself-on-the-back stories, but I&#x27;m really proud of this moment, so I&#x27;m gonna share. One time a principal engineer came to me with a data analysis request and told me that the data would be available to me soon, only to come to me an hour later with the bad news that the data was 2 terabytes and I&#x27;d probably have to spin up an EMR cluster. I borrowed a spinning disk USB drive, loaded all the data into a SQLite database, and had his analysis done before he could even set up a cluster with Spark. The proud moment comes when he tells his boss that we already had the analysis done despite his warning that it might take a few days because &quot;big data&quot;. It was then that I got to tell him about this phenomenal new technology called SQLite and he set up a seminar where I got to teach big data engineers how to use it :)<p>P.S.

They&#x27;ve shown that it can handily outperform Hadoop (at least in the canonical wordcount example shown in this talk[1] -- there may be other examples, I haven&#x27;t actually watched the talk yet). They&#x27;ve used it to mine terabytes of logs, daily, as described in this talk[2] and others apparently have used it as well.<p>From the abstract[3] describing the first talk, about the project:<p><i>We will describe our experiences using Erlang within Nokia to build Disco, a lean and flexible MapReduce framework for large-scale data analysis that scales to large clusters and is used in production at Nokia. Disco is an open-source project that was started in 2008 when attempts to use Hadoop to analyze data proved to be a painful experience. The MapReduce step formed only a portion of the analytics stack, and it was felt that it would be faster to write a custom implementation that would integrate well, than adapt Hadoop with the amount of internal Hadoop expertise available. Among the crucial tasks of such an implementation would be to deal with cluster monitoring, fault- tolerance, and the management and scheduling of a large number of concurrent and distributed jobs. To keep the implementation simple, the use of a platform that provided first-class support for distribution and concurrency was imperative. This motivated the choice of Erlang&#x2F;OTP to implement the core control plane of Disco. It bears stressing that this choice was driven primarily by pragmatic concerns, as opposed to any beliefs about the superiority of functional programming languages in general or Erlang in particular.</i><p>The project&#x27;s homepage [0] has information, a link to its Github, etc.<p>[0] <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;discoproject.org&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;discoproject.org&#x2F;</a><p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;IjOGUC-iR_Q\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;IjOGUC-iR_Q</a><p>[2] <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;vimeo.com&#x2F;23550705\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;vimeo.com&#x2F;23550705</a><p>[3] <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;cufp.org&#x2F;2011&#x2F;disco-using-erlang-implement-mapreduce-nokia.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;cufp.org&#x2F;2011&#x2F;disco-using-erlang-implement-mapreduce-...</a>", "parent": 11450866.0, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": null, "id": 11459455, "ranking": null, "date": 1460165921000, "year": 2016}, {"by": "icecoldice", "score": 2.0, "time": 1460285524, "timestamp": 1460285524000, "title": "Tableau Big Data Competition and $500 Free for Google Cloud Platform", "type": "story", "url": "http://tabsoft.co/1VukeyP", "text": "", "parent": null, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": 1.0, "id": 11465697, "ranking": null, "date": 1460285524000, "year": 2016}, {"by": "icecoldice", "score": null, "time": 1460285536, "timestamp": 1460285536000, "title": "", "type": "comment", "url": "", "text": "Have you seen that Google has teamed up with @Tableau to find the next #BigDataChamp.

But there are precious few examples in the wild where we&#x27;re dealing with crazy powers like that. I think the bigger (but still quite small) failure in P&#x27;s ability to measure &quot;ease&quot; of computation is that it only considers the worst case. A good example is graph isomorphism. There was recently a development of a quasipolynomial algorithm for graph isomorphism, which had the best bound we&#x27;ve found for the problem yet. However, with our existing algorithms it was <i>extremely</i> difficult to find examples where they didn&#x27;t run in polynomial time, even when actively looking for them. But again, this is the exception, not the rule.<p>&gt; Second, for many problems even O(n^2) is too much (think of big data problems). (Also, given that computation requires physical resources, you cannot scale it arbitrarily.) So even in P the actual exponent matters a lot.<p>Very true, but TCS spends a lot of time developing new algorithms to shrink exponents as well. A lot of the methods and skills needed for making better algorithms to get problems into P also apply to moving them around within P. And many of the same tactics for trying to figure out exactly how P and NP fit together apply to trying to figure out the same for P and BQP.<p>Since you have a background in quantum physics and (I assume) care about that field, are you aware that quite a bit of the TCS community works on quantum problems? There have been plenty of results that stand to be very physically relevant. Some good examples are the recent (quite rapid) progress in analyzing symmetric cryptography schemes&#x27; vulnerability to attacks by a quantum computers[1]. Interestingly, many are starting from  the same jumping off that asymmetric attacks did; namely Simon&#x27;s algorithm (an important stepping stone towards Shor&#x27;s algorithm).<p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;1602.05973\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;1602.05973</a>", "parent": 11914950.0, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": null, "id": 11915340, "ranking": null, "date": 1466075470000, "year": 2016}, {"by": "kawera", "score": 2.0, "time": 1466115859, "timestamp": 1466115859000, "title": "Big data is people", "type": "story", "url": "https://aeon.co/essays/why-big-data-is-actually-small-personal-and-very-human", "text": "", "parent": null, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": 0.0, "id": 11919354, "ranking": null, "date": 1466115859000, "year": 2016}, {"by": "sbachman", "score": 5.0, "time": 1466252199, "timestamp": 1466252199000, "title": "Big Data Comes to Game of Thrones", "type": "story", "url": "http://www.geektime.com/2016/06/18/big-data-comes-to-game-of-thrones/", "text": "", "parent": null, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": 0.0, "id": 11928210, "ranking": null, "date": 1466252199000, "year": 2016}, {"by": "vincentg64", "score": 2.0, "time": 1466278131, "timestamp": 1466278131000, "title": "Book: Introducing Data Science: Big Data, Machine Learning with Python", "type": "story", "url": "http://www.datasciencecentral.com/profiles/blog/show?id=6448529%3ABlogPost%3A436747", "text": "", "parent": null, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": 0.0, "id": 11930187, "ranking": null, "date": 1466278131000, "year": 2016}, {"by": "fforflo", "score": 2.0, "time": 1466288592, "timestamp": 1466288592000, "title": "Theory in the Time of Big Data", "type": "story", "url": "https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2016/06/18/theory-in-the-time-of-big-data/", "text": "", "parent": null, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": 0.0, "id": 11930901, "ranking": null, "date": 1466288592000, "year": 2016}, {"by": "alxsanchez", "score": 1.0, "time": 1466435505, "timestamp": 1466435505000, "title": "The future of big data is open source", "type": "story", "url": "http://dataconomy.com/the-future-of-big-data-is-open-source/", "text": "", "parent": null, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": 0.0, "id": 11938518, "ranking": null, "date": 1466435505000, "year": 2016}, {"by": "EduardoNJF", "score": 1.0, "time": 1466513160, "timestamp": 1466513160000, "title": "Are you a programmer looking for an alternative to Dropbox, Google or Uber?", "type": "story", "url": "", "text": "Are you interested in deep machine learning research, big data or platform engineering?<p>Can you program in C++, Python or JavaScript?

It grabs and creates data sets of relevant contractors (like a construction contractor, or a manufacturing contractor, etc) and goes through them, compiling lists of emails. The Weapon could be used for other purposes too. We may commercialize it later.<p>The problem is, I had a meeting with a VC firm, and they told me about Anti-Spam laws in Canada that could be pertinent. I looked through relevant documentation and the fines are minor for unsolicited emails, but according to a mentor of ours it could damage our reputation..<p>The thing is, The Weapon could be a great tool to help us get liquidity on the supply-side of our marketplace at launch. I don&#x27;t want to take a longer, more strenuous route to liquidity, when there have been other companies like BuildZoom that have built and used similar tools to help them get liquidity (in the States). It would be a disadvantage to us to not deploy The Weapon.<p>The fines are minor, I&#x27;m not really worried about my reputation (Its comparable to when Travis Kalanick ignored San Franciscos cease &amp; desist when Uber was in its infancy), but I also don&#x27;t want to turn off potential investors who might think I&#x27;m reckless for nullifying regulations that are onerous and an impediment to our innovation.<p>I wanted to ask the community - would you deploy The Weapon, if it meant getting your startup off the ground, even if it meant risking a small fine, and your reputation with some people? I plan on always being straight forward with VCs and tell them how we used The Weapon to get to liquidity. I won&#x27;t hide it, or conceal the fact that we may or may not have broken anti-spam regulation, because that would be illegal and I&#x27;d end up like Parker Conrad.<p>Thoughts?", "parent": null, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": 10.0, "id": 12113305, "ranking": null, "date": 1468818402000, "year": 2016}, {"by": "Datafloq", "score": 1.0, "time": 1468824611, "timestamp": 1468824611000, "title": "How Big Data Completely Transformed the Insurance Industry", "type": "story", "url": "https://datafloq.com/read/big-data-completely-transformed-insurance-industry/2178", "text": "", "parent": null, "deleted": null, "dead": true, "descendants": null, "id": 12113547, "ranking": null, "date": 1468824611000, "year": 2016}, {"by": "Lordarminius", "score": 1.0, "time": 1468855214, "timestamp": 1468855214000, "title": "The perils of relying on third parties for your big data", "type": "story", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/16/big-data-and-its-developer-fallout/", "text": "", "parent": null, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": 0.0, "id": 12115577, "ranking": null, "date": 1468855214000, "year": 2016}, {"by": "Rivery", "score": 1.0, "time": 1469003050, "timestamp": 1469003050000, "title": "Rivery launches with a cloud service for easy big data integrations", "type": "story", "url": "https://rivery.io/", "text": "", "parent": null, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": 0.0, "id": 12127574, "ranking": null, "date": 1469003050000, "year": 2016}, {"by": "Datafloq", "score": 1.0, "time": 1469021937, "timestamp": 1469021937000, "title": "Why Big Data Fuels Significant Change in the Real Estate Market", "type": "story", "url": "https://datafloq.com/read/why-big-data-fuels-significant-change-real-estate/2183", "text": "", "parent": null, "deleted": null, "dead": true, "descendants": null, "id": 12128885, "ranking": null, "date": 1469021937000, "year": 2016}, {"by": "lselig", "score": 1.0, "time": 1469046307, "timestamp": 1469046307000, "title": "Sr.Big Data Developer", "type": "story", "url": "https://www.snaplogic.com/about-us/jobs/202", "text": "", "parent": null, "deleted": null, "dead": true, "descendants": null, "id": 12132211, "ranking": null, "date": 1469046307000, "year": 2016}, {"by": "robinwauters", "score": 1.0, "time": 1469085255, "timestamp": 1469085255000, "title": "How Dimension Data is bringing big data to the Tour de France", "type": "story", "url": "http://tech.eu/features/10722/dimension-data-tour-de-france/", "text": "", "parent": null, "deleted": null, "dead": true, "descendants": null, "id": 12135278, "ranking": null, "date": 1469085255000, "year": 2016}, {"by": "Applite", "score": 1.0, "time": 1469090625, "timestamp": 1469090625000, "title": "A New Concept in Healthcare-Little Gadgets and Big Data", "type": "story", "url": "http://applite.eu/new-concept-healthcare-little-gadgets-big-data-1441.html", "text": "", "parent": null, "deleted": null, "dead": true, "descendants": null, "id": 12135566, "ranking": null, "date": 1469090625000, "year": 2016}, {"by": "lmm", "score": null, "time": 1469117765, "timestamp": 1469117765000, "title": "", "type": "comment", "url": "", "text": "&gt; 1.

Two copies of a monolith wastes less RAM etc. than five components of which you deploy two copies of one.<p>&gt; 2. Being able to build-and-deploy any one module much faster than one monolithic bundle of local dependencies<p>Maybe, but first see if you can make build-and-deploy of the whole thing fast.

Universal interface with language-agnostic applications. Do you need to expose big data statistical analytics, but can&#x27;t find data engineers that are comfortable with Java&#x2F;Node.js&#x2F;Go?

I can tell you work in Enterprise as well and I feel your pain brother&#x2F;sister.<p>1. Everyone is willing to sell you something that is going to manage all of your disparate legacy data, except that somehow nothing ever seems to die in the Enterprise and instead you end up with users of the unmaintainable legacy system AND a second system on top (and third, and fourth) that now also all need to be maintained.<p>&gt; Analysis and reporting are the easy part.<p>I don&#x27;t agree on this point. They&#x27;re just as hard as ever. Of course you have Excel, Reporting Services, and Power BI. But everyone wants you to formulate the QUESTIONS as well as the ANSWERS. As soon as they discover all of the issues you&#x27;ve found, now it&#x27;s bury-your-head-in-the-sand-time, because they just want to whittle it down to that top 1% of 1% of problems so that their stats look good; whack it into a daily email, which goes onto a daily KPI sheet, and the underlying issues they originally wanted to know about of course never (or rarely) get fixed. Progress!<p>2. Let me tell you about Big Data! It&#x27;s a codeword for:<p>* We know you&#x27;ve never archived or thrown anything away before, that you have data coming out of your ass.<p>* We also know you&#x27;ll never use it. You don&#x27;t have the funds, inclination, or staff to use it. But <i>one day</i> we&#x27;re going to build something that will magically do it all for you. So you better keep holding onto it.<p>* Oh yeah and we have something to sell you to help you keep holding onto it all until that magical day arrives! Please send us a purchase order. Thanks.<p>I love data. I am sure that some companies like energy companies and telecoms do actually have to deal with massive amounts of data. But Big Data has become a management buzzword that doesn&#x27;t mean much except retaining everything and spending money.<p>If you retain everything you never have to make a decision about what to destroy. Management <i>loathe</i> having to make a decision to destroy anything that they might be held liable for, but also <i>love</i> spending money on something that they can use to justify that they&#x27;re solving a problem.<p>Thus the success of Big Data.<p>3. Predictive. I can&#x27;t comment. Everyone talks about it but I don&#x27;t see the solutions in the real world. Most of us are stuck in Excel &#x2F; SQL and just starting to dip our toes into R. When everything else in life is hard, predictive becomes just another harder thing to avoid.<p>&gt; There is some light at the end of the tunnel.<p>What you&#x27;re talking about is Master Data. Of course the well for this has already been poisoned long ago and woe to all who sip from it.<p>Everyone loves starting an MD project that siphons data in. But the second people have to manage the data inside and start cleansing it and making decisions - it falls in a heap. It rarely gets to the stage where data is then written back to source systems it&#x27;s game over (LOLOLOL many a vendor I have left in the dust just asking them about this - &quot;That&#x27;s phase 2&quot; they say - and they&#x27;ve never had any single customer reach it).<p>--<p>Back on point about the article though, it looks like an interesting way to structure data and it could probably do as an Excel add-on of some kind. I expected something that would create a database but unless there&#x27;s more than the video this is just writing queries?<p>This is all well and fine, I guess, if it adds usability. But <i>nobody&#x27;s</i> jobs are going anywhere. The article says this tool can create anything SQL-92 can. Good luck...

Currently, most remote-sensing data, astronomical data, etc. is stored in data silos around the world. A lot of the data remains unprocessed unfortunately.<p>With the wealth of data being downlinked from space every day, there&#x27;s a pressing need for a new, global system for acquisition, storage, processing and distribution. We&#x27;re aiming to develop a system that is replicated, resilient (i.e., no single points of failure) and verified.<p>One of the ideas we want to explore is using the blockchain to distribute data globally; an idea that others seem to be looking into [2]. It&#x27;s quite an attractive prospect to have a fully decentralized system that is independent of any centralized clearinghouse for data distribution. The main objections for space data seem to be related to privacy and national security. The data is also highly varied&#x2F;unstructured.<p>Since my knowledge of blockchain technology is limited to a cursory overview, I was wondering if the HN community could help me get insight into the following questions:<p>1. What are potential technology limitations that would restrict use of the blockchain for management and distribution of big data?<p>2. Since I assume that the data can&#x27;t be stored directly in the blockchain, is there a way to store the data reliably elsewhere and utilize the blockchain for decentralized registration&#x2F;lookup?<p>And finally, as part of our survey:<p>3. What would you use space data for?<p>Thanks in advance!<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ssp16.isunet.edu<p>[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blogs.informatica.com&#x2F;2016&#x2F;05&#x2F;11&#x2F;linking-up-blockchain-and-data-integration&#x2F;", "parent": null, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": 2.0, "id": 12156858, "ranking": null, "date": 1469428409000, "year": 2016}, {"by": "Datafloq", "score": 1.0, "time": 1469444879, "timestamp": 1469444879000, "title": "Top Reasons of Hadoop \u2013 Big Data Project Failures", "type": "story", "url": "https://datafloq.com/read/top-reasons-of-hadoop-big-data-project-failures/2185", "text": "", "parent": null, "deleted": null, "dead": true, "descendants": null, "id": 12157816, "ranking": null, "date": 1469444879000, "year": 2016}, {"by": "brudgers", "score": null, "time": 1469458632, "timestamp": 1469458632000, "title": "", "type": "comment", "url": "", "text": "My take is that a small proof of concept would provide the best class of answers.

This was on MySql and that ended up taking up 11 bytes per row, versus a Long which would have just been 8. In one table, maybe not so bad but when you start putting those primary keys into foreign key relationships... we ended up with a 1 billion row table in MySql that had 4 of these columns in it. That might make it &quot;big data&quot; by that definition but it&#x27;s also just bad design.<p>Another example in that same database was using text fields in mysql for storing JSON.

It makes the same general arguments as you.<p>As for &quot;really short code&quot;, yeah technically you write `[]` for a list instead of `new ArrayList()`. Unless of course you want different performance characteristics, then you have to write `from collections import deque` and `deque()` which isn&#x27;t really more convenient or shorter than `new Deque()`.<p>And yeah you can use the global function `open` and the method `read` to quickly get file contents. But you can write wrapper functions around the Java or C# equivalents if needed. It&#x27;s just that usually you need more fine-grained control over what&#x27;s happening than that in real-world code.<p>And while I&#x27;m not really a fan of the `new` keyword or the fact that everything has to be within a class definition, a good IDE makes that stuff painless.<p>And it&#x27;s true that you don&#x27;t have to declare types in Python. But then you lose the ability to control-click a type name of a variable to go to its definition, to know what you can do with it or how it works.<p>As for &quot;cleanest&quot; code, that&#x27;s definitely not a matter of syntax or even what the standard library looks like. Clean code can be written in any language. I&#x27;ve seen clean code in Ruby, Python, Haskell, Clojure, Java, C#, Swift, Objective-C, heck even C. (Never C++ though, but I don&#x27;t doubt it probably exists somewhere.)<p>As for having libraries for everything, so does every major language, including the ones I just mentioned.<p>And I sincerely doubt that Python is the fastest for big data crunching. From what I&#x27;ve read, the situation is more like, Python is very popular among data scientists, but they got fed up with how slow it is in general, especially at numbers, so they wrote a Python library for number crunching implemented in C to make it really fast, and now it&#x27;s like as fast as Java finally.<p>[1]: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.programcreek.com&#x2F;2012&#x2F;04&#x2F;java-vs-python-why-python-can-be-more-productive&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.programcreek.com&#x2F;2012&#x2F;04&#x2F;java-vs-python-why-pytho...</a>", "parent": 12589516.0, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": null, "id": 12589818, "ranking": null, "date": 1474986631000, "year": 2016}, {"by": "michael_douglas", "score": 4.0, "time": 1475047592, "timestamp": 1475047592000, "title": "Cloud Machine Learning Platforms vs. Apache Spark Solutions", "type": "story", "url": "", "text": "Cloud giants like Amazon, Google, Azure and IBM have rushed into the big data analytics cloud market.

Getting Hadoop up and running is also a facet in a practical working definition of &#x27;knowing Hadoop.&#x27;<p>2. Linux Wireless driver BLOB&#x27;s have been a source of pain for me. The work arounds for me have been:<p>a. Purchase well supported hardware, e.g. used Thinkpad and cards without obscure Broadcom chips.<p>b. Use an external wireless router and an ethernet cable. That&#x27;s how I connect desktops and laptops around the office.<p>3. My gut is that the important knowledge for many positions requiring or preferring Hadoop will be more related to data science than technical expertise. On the other hand, looping back to my earlier advice, positions that are Hadoop first rather than data-science first will benefit from an operational understanding.<p>Lastly, what I&#x27;ve been hearing about the industry, is that &#x27;embarrassingly parallel workloads that can take full advantage of Hadoop are not as common as was thought a few years ago. The big useful innovation of Hadoop is looking like the underlying Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) and other big data search&#x2F;query tools are being built over it.<p>That&#x27;s not to say Hadoop is dead or not worth exploring, particularly at the technical level of HDFS and in terms of applying data-science concepts. Learning Pig or Hive makes sense in service of learning how to apply data science concepts.

In particular, Julia offers a unique combination of productivity and speed for numerical work that can&#x27;t be found anywhere else.", "parent": 12685525.0, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": null, "id": 12686045, "ranking": null, "date": 1476204192000, "year": 2016}, {"by": "markgainor1", "score": 2.0, "time": 1476213921, "timestamp": 1476213921000, "title": "5 Real-World Big Data and IoT Scenarios to Test, for Free", "type": "story", "url": "http://www.talend.com/blog/2016/09/20/choose-your-own-big-data-adventure-getting-started-with-talend%E2%80%99s-new-big-data", "text": "", "parent": null, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": 0.0, "id": 12687700, "ranking": null, "date": 1476213921000, "year": 2016}, {"by": "Datafloq", "score": 1.0, "time": 1476251271, "timestamp": 1476251271000, "title": "Why Big Data as a Service Is the Hottest Trend in Cloud Now", "type": "story", "url": "https://datafloq.com/read/why-big-data-as-a-service-hottest-trend-cloud/2387", "text": "", "parent": null, "deleted": null, "dead": true, "descendants": null, "id": 12690665, "ranking": null, "date": 1476251271000, "year": 2016}, {"by": "streamanalytix", "score": 2.0, "time": 1476251894, "timestamp": 1476251894000, "title": "Big Data Streaming Analytics \u2013 Apache Spark Streaming", "type": "story", "url": "http://streamanalytix.com/news-coverage", "text": "", "parent": null, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": 0.0, "id": 12690690, "ranking": null, "date": 1476251894000, "year": 2016}, {"by": "eljefe6a", "score": 10.0, "time": 1476297849, "timestamp": 1476297849000, "title": "Getting Stuck Crawling with Big Data", "type": "story", "url": "http://www.jesse-anderson.com/2016/10/getting-stuck-crawling-with-big-data/", "text": "", "parent": null, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": 0.0, "id": 12695468, "ranking": null, "date": 1476297849000, "year": 2016}, {"by": "Datafloq", "score": 1.0, "time": 1476345509, "timestamp": 1476345509000, "title": "What Does It Mean to Be a Big Data Snooper?", "type": "story", "url": "https://datafloq.com/read/what-does-it-mean-to-be-a-big-data-snooper/2380", "text": "", "parent": null, "deleted": null, "dead": true, "descendants": null, "id": 12699212, "ranking": null, "date": 1476345509000, "year": 2016}, {"by": "e_py", "score": 1.0, "time": 1476348409, "timestamp": 1476348409000, "title": "What to do when your job is not what you thought it would be?", "type": "story", "url": "", "text": "Hi everyone,<p>I am a 26yo engineer from Spain.

"I&#x27;ve been in my current company for 2 years now and recently embarked on a new project and a new team within the company, this is a &quot;big data&quot; shop but the current focus seems to be on &quot;platform provisioning&quot; and devops.<p>Our manager has been tasked with coming up with new &quot;standards&quot;, tools and processes for everything.The team has been divided and a new &quot;leadership&quot; team has been formed and the existing developers have been sort of left out, one of the things that really bothers me is the over complexity and artificial constraints being enforced, it&#x27;s not that I&#x27;m not open to change but as I&#x27;ve grown older and experienced (and I have to admit, cynical) whenever I see unnecesary complexity I run away screaming.<p>Just to give you an example of what I&#x27;m talking about:\nThe deployment, provisioning and packaging workflow that these guys have come up with is an absolute nightmare form my point of view, consisting of multiple ansible &amp; gradle scripts, packaging everything as RPM files, convoluted code review processes using crucible, and git branching strategy based on jira tickets, etc, etc this is a standard that must be followed for EVERYTHING, have a simple 3 line bash script? oh you have to write a gradle build file, &quot;tests&quot; and ansible scripts to provision it.<p>I have to admit I

Error bars don&#x27;t take this into account and people over rely on error bars - especially with complex domains.\nThen there are the intentional and unintentional sampling biases in the polls that have to be taken into account. Then there are known human effects that add additional biases. E.g. the shy voter effect (e.g. Torres and Brexit), silent majorities (Nixon), momentum, dam breaking (Reagan), enthusiasm gap (Obama), the giant fk you to the establishment vote, pending indictments etc. In my view with the election being so emotional this year these effects are big enough to swing it to Trump making a poll based model wildly inaccurate.<p>I&#x27;ve taken an actual position in the election. $4k on Trump to win at 15% odds made just after the tapes. At the time I felt Trump had at least 50% chance so the bet was positive expected return for me. I figured the public would get over it. My Bayesian friends had his odds at 2%. Today I consider Trump to be at least 70% with the whole FBI inditement saga picking up steam.<p>In addition, the betting market behavior mirrors Brexit. A few very big bets on the status quo and many small bets against.

They ask me to spend more time reading contracts, do emails and blame people instead of resolving engineering problems. This kills me inside. No engineering is actually spent in forming a product.

Eventually my research hit a data wall (my simulations produced too much data for my storage and processing system).  I had read a paper on GFS and Mapreduce and Bigtable from Google, and decided to go work there.  I got hired onto an SRE (production ops) team and spent my 20% time learning how production data processing works at scale.<p>After a few years I understood stuff better and moved my pipelines to MapReduce.  And I built a bigger simulator (Exacycle).  It was easy to process 100+T datasets in an hour or so.  It wasn&#x27;t a lot of work, really.  We converted external data forms to protobufs and stored them in various container files.  Then we ported the code that computed various parameters from the simulation to MapReduce.<p>I took this knowledge, looked at the market, and heard &quot;storing genomic data is hard&quot;.  After some research, I found that storing genomic data isn&#x27;t hard at all.  People spend all their time complaining about storage and performance, but when you look, they&#x27;re using tin can telephones and wind up toy cars.  This is because most scientists specialize in their science, not in data processing.  So, based on this I built a product called &#x27;Google Cloud Genomics&#x27; which stores petabytes of data (some public, some private for customers).  Our customers love it- they do all their processing in Google Cloud, with fast access to petabytes of data.  We&#x27;ve turned something that required them to hire expensive sysadmins and data scientists into something their regular scientists can just use (for example, from BigQuery or Python).<p>One of the things that really irked me about genomic data is that for several years people were predicting exponential growth of sequencing and similar rates of storage needs.  They made ludicrous projections and complained that not enough hard drives were made to store their forthcoming volumes.  oh, and the storage cost too much, too.  Well, the reality is that genomic data doesn&#x27;t ahve enough value to archive it for long times (sorry, folks, for those that believe it: your BAM files don&#x27;t have value enough for you to pay the incredibly low rates storage providers charge!  Also, we can just order more harddrives, Seagate just produces drive to meet demand, so if there is a real demand signal and money behind it, the drives will be made.  Actual genomic data is tiny compared to cat videos.<p>The real issue is that most researchers don&#x27;t have the tools or incentives to properly collect, store, and use big data.  Until that is fixed, the field will continue in a crisis.", "parent": 13073066.0, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": null, "id": 13075440, "ranking": null, "date": 1480546238000, "year": 2016}, {"by": "markgainor1", "score": 2.0, "time": 1480547916, "timestamp": 1480547916000, "title": "3 Ways to Automate Big Data on AWS", "type": "story", "url": "http://www.talend.com/blog/2016/05/27/talend-integration-cloud-aws-3-ways-to-automate-big-data-part-1", "text": "", "parent": null, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": 0.0, "id": 13075593, "ranking": null, "date": 1480547916000, "year": 2016}, {"by": "dcgoss", "score": null, "time": 1480555904, "timestamp": 1480555904000, "title": "", "type": "comment", "url": "", "text": "If you&#x27;re interested in working on an open source project involving big data, machine learning and cancer, check out cognoma.org.

http:&#x2F;&#x2F;dba.stackexchange.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;162008&#x2F;deciding-on-the-right-database-for-big-data<p>We&#x27;ve identified the following requirements of a database:<p>- <i>Thousands of inserts&#x2F;updates per second</i><p>- <i>Has an solid aggregation strategy</i>: Aggregating data in N different ways is really important to us, any hindrance in our ability to aggregate data is going to slow us down.<p>- <i>Store + query related data</i> (hierarchical&#x2F;recursive JSON) -- ideally efficiently, but not required: getting the data out in a useful format is very important to us.<p>- <i>Partition tolerant</i> (easily clustered, automated replication)<p>- <i>Availability</i> (heavy reads + writes): same story as the partition tolerance. Availability requirements scale with the popularity of the video games we&#x27;re storing data for.<p>With those requirements in mind, we&#x27;ve been mulling over a few different choices.<p>- <i>Cassandra</i>: Nails the partition tolerance and availability requirements, but it&#x27;s very limited in querying capability. Also has the intriguing ScyllaDB, which could prove to provide us with more capacity if needed. With the addition of Spark to our infrastructure, Cassandra may be a good fit for our aggregation needs as well. (And we realize Riak + others are compatible with Spark as well.)<p>- <i>MongoDB</i>: Native support for JSON could be a big plus. Has a built in aggregation pipeline, but we&#x27;re unsure of its capability. Not too enthused with the master-slave replication - again we&#x27;re not overly concerned with consistency.<p>- <i>Postgres</i>: Maybe we don&#x27;t need NoSQL yet? With the right partitioning strategy, an RDBMS could prove to work for our use case. Postgres has (from what I can tell) excellent support for JSON. Indexing on JSON properties could prove to be very useful for aggregation queries.", "parent": null, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": 3.0, "id": 13467992, "ranking": null, "date": 1485220505000, "year": 2017}, {"by": "adhorden", "score": 3.0, "time": 1485248039, "timestamp": 1485248039000, "title": "Towards a Realtime Streaming Architecture", "type": "story", "url": "", "text": "Towards a Realtime Streaming Architecture<p>The story behind our move from Spark streaming to Kafka streams for realtime processing and ingestion to Hadoop.<p>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;engineering.skybettingandgaming.com&#x2F;2017&#x2F;01&#x2F;23&#x2F;streaming-architectures&#x2F;<p>Alice Kaerast Big Data Architect Data Tribe at Sky Betting and Gaming", "parent": null, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": 0.0, "id": 13469793, "ranking": null, "date": 1485248039000, "year": 2017}, {"by": "skynode", "score": null, "time": 1485264880, "timestamp": 1485264880000, "title": "", "type": "comment", "url": "", "text": "&gt; As I&#x27;m writing this, I understand that there will be repercussions some day for making inflammatory comments like this online.

Would you really pay 200k plus for a person with my level of experience? Hiring a person with more experience for my position and paying 200k plus does not make sense because they would be over qualified for what I do. Also, there are not enough local developers with 2-4 years of exp with my skill set.

I am pretty sure that I can make more than 180k in NC by the time I turn 32-33 but I will need to upgrade my skills at that point. I am already looking at Blockchain instead of waiting for my company to train me.

We\u2019re onto something big but to get there we\u2019re working through complex problems in a complex and often old-fashioned problem domain.

We&#x27;re the skunkworks off-shoot of an existing logistics company, Experior Transport. We founded this startup to address logistics challenges we&#x27;ve faced since we started Experior nearly 20 years ago. It turns out most of our trucking competitors face the same problems, and the industry at-large isn&#x27;t making much progress to solve them. The solutions we&#x27;re developing are targeting real problems with real monetization potential. The founders have a good understanding of both the logistics industry, trucking, and programming - so working with us isn&#x27;t going to be an exercise in dealing with a pointy-haired boss with an MBA.

HR can also put their hand in the pot when they try to use buzzwords (e.g. Hadooop) to internally justify why a role with 2 years of experience needs to be paid like other roles (e.g. traditional Excel based Analyst) with 5-10 years of experience.<p>&gt;&gt;They tend to have a short description of the role, which is generally filled with buzzwords, followed by a list of requirements. I wish organizations would talk about what they wanted to do with their data instead.<p>One major challenge for Data Scientists is how hyped the role is, leading to people in an organization believing whatever they want about Data Scientists.  Are you a leader who wants a business analyst who can use software and interface with IT?  Data Scientist.  Are you an engineering manager who wants a person who can interface with the business and use machine learning?  Data Scientist.  Are you a VP who thinks big data and ML is the problem to your bad or non-existent data?  Data Scientist.  Do you want somebody who can exhale the maximum amount of hot air while still sounding like a tech and math genius?  Data Scientist.<p>Also add in that business people with minimal experience in modern Analytics are trying to build up Data Science and Analytics capabilities in their own part of the organization because they realize Excel is not the answer to every question.  I&#x27;ve spent a lot of time speaking with people to help them understand the type of people they need to hire.  Sometimes people are sensible and sensible job descriptions and expectations come from that.

I agree with it, but also, the term &quot;big data&quot; is relevant to a point in time, I think.  I mean, VLDB was the term before &quot;big data&quot; - I think when the term &quot;big data&quot; became popular was when technology such as Hadoop became more mainstream and available instead of just being used in special cases.<p>I was working with terabytes of data in SQL Server prior to 2008 (around 2004&#x2F;2005 - which was doable but pushing some limits) and then got into Hadoop etc. afterwards.  It was interesting to reach the limits of a tech we were using and be there for the transition to Hadoop etc.<p>There were expensive commercial alternatives - MPP databases like Teradata, Netezza or Vertica - or things like scientific computing platforms (which were very limited to scientific computing scenarios).  But nothing was as.. mainstream and available as Hadoop became.  And yet, Hadoop never really completely beat the traditional MPP vendors until you started getting engines like Impala, Presto, Spark etc. that made SQL on top of Hadoop easier.  And that took quite a while.. in fact I&#x27;d say making SQL on top of Hadoop work well (among many other things) is probably still on-going in a way.  We are much, much further along with that now than we were.<p>On the other hand, it was interesting to see the new opportunities develop for working with data other than just SQL - straight MapReduce, machine learning, graph processing, DAG, etc.<p>Will be interesting to see where we go from here.

I think Hadoop is losing its popularity or from a different point of view, it got 90% of its potential market saturated and having trouble entering other markets. The biggest challenges are operational stability and performance, and the lack of understanding from the Hadoop companies about the performance characteristics of their system. On the top of that there is always 2 version of everything (Tez vs Impala, ORC vs Parquet, etc.) because HWX and Cloudera cannot really work together in an opensource fashion. On the top of everything there are better products on the market for different use cases for Hadoop. The following list is incomplete: Alluxio, Apache Beam, Apache Kudu. These systems trying to address some of the aforementioned shortcomings of Hadoop. There are other products like PrestoDB that take a slightly different approach to a particular problem (accessing data via SQL like interface) and mix it with a extra goodness (in memory caching) and delivering an entirely different customer experience. If you leave Hadoop land you can also play with Spark or Storm (depending on your use case).

No model is ever &quot;fixed&quot; if that means 100% correct.<p>Flu trends worked well (much better than a &quot;simple model of local temperatures&quot;) except in the 2009 flu season, when it missed the A&#x2F;H1N1 pandemic.

I would link it, but it seems it hasn&#x27;t been published by our Conf team yet.<p>We did this on 9.4 so the changes outlined here regarding native partitioning, parallel queries, replication improvements, etc. would likely make doing a similar scaling structure easier and just straight up more performant.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t classify 1 Billion metrics a day as &quot;Big Data&quot;.  I also would point out that our use case is unfairly biased to &quot;recent&quot; data rather than &quot;all historical&quot; data...which allows us to make some query optimizations that wouldn&#x27;t be acceptable in the latter use case.<p><i>But</i> we are using Postgres to host a constant, write-heavy workload that conventional wisdom dictates it is unsuited for.  Moreover, it was&#x2F;is fairly simple to implement, understand, and scale indefinitely.  Personally, I think both Redshift and CitusData are various degrees of proof that scaling Postgres to handle these types of workloads is possible.<p>For me, the reason you want to consider using a Big Data focused tool (such as Cassandra) is at some point you end up fighting your tool to make a square peg fit in a round hole.  At some point it makes more sense to adopt a specialized tool rather than work to specialize your implementation of a specific tool.<p>In all fairness, we are considering just that.  Our road map actually has Scylla in the near future.  It&#x27;s not that we don&#x27;t think Postgres <i>could</i> handle the load, but rather we think it will be <i>easier</i> to move specific data to Scylla and in the long run will save us resources (primarily in man hours and potentially in compute requirements as well).<p>Even if we move all our timeseries data to a specialized tool, we won&#x27;t be getting rid of Postgres.  For most&#x2F;if not all our other persistence requirements Postgres is more than adequate.  This is one of the reasons we chose to start with Postgres: even once we hit a scale that specialized tools made sense, Postgres would still be useful for everything else that doesn&#x27;t require a specialized tool.<p>Moral of the story: Postgres will get you a lot farther than many give it credit for...and if you are just starting out I would highly encourage you to just pick Postgres and see how far it can take you.

Peergrade is a tool for educators to run peer feedback and peer assessment sessions with their students. Peer feedback is a way to train skills like critical thinking, constructing arguments and how to give and receive feedback - all skills that we believe will be even more important in the job market of the future.<p>I teach a university course in data science at The Technical University of Denmark. Two years ago my course suddenly grew from 20 to 150 students (I changed the title to include &quot;big data&quot;). To overcome the sudden explosion in students, I started working on Peergrade. The idea was that I could save some time on grading papers, the students could write better feedback than me since they had more time per paper, they would learn from reading and assessing each others work and I could reallocate the time I saved to more impactful things like mentoring students.<p>One of the things we heard from teachers that had tried peer feedback before was that it was challenging to motivate students to write helpful feedback. One of the ways we try to solve this is by letting students assess the feedback they receive, consequently giving a clear incentive for writing helpful feedback. To combat gaming and unfair assessments, students give feedback anonymously and they can flag feedback which they disagree with for moderation by the teacher. Since students are able to flag and counter-argue the feedback they receive, they also spend more time reading and thinking about the feedback.<p>Today Peergrade is used in institutions around the world, all the way from 4th grade to higher education, across all subjects and with class sizes from just 5 students to thousands of students.<p>We look forward to answering any questions you might have about our product, tech-stack or vision for the future :).", "parent": null, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": 18.0, "id": 15332306, "ranking": null, "date": 1506360678000, "year": 2017}, {"by": "mcguire", "score": null, "time": 1506381274, "timestamp": 1506381274000, "title": "", "type": "comment", "url": "", "text": "&quot;<i>the academic CS establishment</i>&quot;<p>Strictly speaking, I think that term attributes more organization to the academic CS establishment than my experience supports.<p>The point here is that, if they&#x27;re trying to establish that Smart Technique 2 is better than Smart Technique 1, they need to first establish that Stupid Technique Q doesn&#x27;t work at all.

Today people are starting to use GUI tools (e.g. Pentaho) for ETL and SQL is replacing writing map-reduce code for many people.  Proper Data Engineers with solid technical skills are still heavily in demand, but many of the pseudo-technical people are finding their jobs are changing.<p>You see something similar with AI and ML.  10 years ago AI was &quot;dead&quot; and ML&#x2F;Stats was for expert CS and Stats people.  Now you can do a lot with a few lines of code or API calls.

What I&#x27;m suggesting is that a two-phase workflow for analytics may actually make more sense than trying to unify things.  (Here, I&#x27;m considering analytics as distinct from big data in products, where you really need to compute on every user&#x27;s data or every web page).<p>Basically you have a disk-backed distributed column store with petabytes of data.  At Google this is Dremel:<p>&quot;Dremel: interactive analysis of web-scale datasets&quot;<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;scholar.google.com&#x2F;scholar?cluster=15217893017571539153&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0,5&amp;sciodt=0,5\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;scholar.google.com&#x2F;scholar?cluster=15217893017571539...</a><p>And then you write SQL queries against it to load a sample of gigabytes onto a single machine.  Stratified sampling is useful here, so you can representative samples of both big groups and small groups, which tends to happen a lot.  And then you use something like R, Python, or Julia to analyze that subset.<p>Despite the title of the Dremel Paper, it&#x27;s not really good for interactive analysis.  It&#x27;s good for a quick &quot;top K&quot; query, which is sometimes all you need.  But for anything beyond that, it&#x27;s too slow.<p>And SQL is a horrible language for writing analytics in.  The data frame model is much better.  SQL is awesome for loading data though.<p>So I&#x27;m basically suggesting that the SQL&#x2F;disk&#x2F;distributed vs. the Programming language&#x2F;memory&#x2F;local distinction actually works well for most problems.

There&#x27;s also a new issue on our tracker about adding complex number support for nuclear computations and quantum computing:\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tensor-compiler&#x2F;taco&#x2F;issues&#x2F;116\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tensor-compiler&#x2F;taco&#x2F;issues&#x2F;116</a>.<p>The tensor contraction engine is great work, and focuses on dense tensor. We currently optimize for sparse tensors so TCE will do better than us for pure dense expressions. We want to bridge this gap next semester though.<p>The cyclops framework is also great. We discuss it in our related work, but we did not directly compare to it in our evaluation. The first version of it, like TCE, focused on dense tensors, and their main focus is on distributed computing, which we don&#x27;t support yet (we do shared memory parallel execution at the moment). They have some followup work on sparse computations. The difference to our work is that they, if I read their paper correctly, transposes the data until they can call pre-existing matrix multiplication routines. This causes data movement overheads. Our work compiles expressions to work at the data at hand, without moving it.", "parent": 15603663.0, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": null, "id": 15603877, "ranking": null, "date": 1509559622000, "year": 2017}, {"by": "chubot", "score": null, "time": 1509561319, "timestamp": 1509561319000, "title": "", "type": "comment", "url": "", "text": "Right, EDA is all about making quick iterations, and my point is that I can&#x27;t think of ANY use cases for EDA on more than a machine&#x27;s worth of data.  (Other than &quot;top&quot; queries, which are useful, but SQL will give you that.  You don&#x27;t need data frames for simple analysis.)<p>In my experience, when people think they want to &quot;explore&quot; hundreds of terabytes of data (if that&#x27;s even possible), they either don&#x27;t have a good method of sampling (due to database limitations), or they haven&#x27;t considered what kind of sampling they need to answer the question.  I&#x27;m open to counterexamples where you need terabytes or petabytes of data and you can&#x27;t sample, but I can&#x27;t think of any myself.<p>And yes R is too inefficient to handle some problems on a single machine (or multiple machines), but data.table and dplyr are more efficient.  I guess one anti-pattern I would see is -- R is too inefficient, let&#x27;s run R on multiple machines!  I think the better solution is to make use of your machine better, with packages like data.table and dplyr (or a future platform based on Arrow).  I think it&#x27;s easy to underestimate the practical problems of distributed computing.<p>You should really avoid distributed computing when you can!<p>And I agree that once you reach production, you do need different tools.  In my experience, when you are dealing with hundreds of terabytes or petabytes of data, you&#x27;re writing a fairly optimized program with a big data framework.  NOT using data frames.  Big data frameworks are already pretty inefficient -- as you mention, if you run them on a local machine, you see evidence of that.  This is true of all the frameworks at Google written in C++ too.  When you add the data frame abstraction, it&#x27;s only going to get worse.  Every layer adds some overhead.<p>So I am very big on data frames for data analysis obviously, but I question the value of distributed data frames.<p>Bringing it back to the article, having 2 abstractions definitely makes sense.  You want a distributed disk-backed column store for storing huge amounts of data permanently.  And then you want an in-memory format like Arrow for iteratively analyzing data using the data frame abstraction.<p>What&#x27;s not clear to me is that you want a distributed in-memory abstraction as well.  It&#x27;s possible but I think there are so many other problems in the tools for data science -- I can easily name 10 problems with both R and Python ecosystems that are more important than distributed data frames.<p>To play devil&#x27;s advocate, I do see the value in not rewriting your analysis when you go from prototype to production.  I&#x27;m pretty big on that -- I like to ship the prototypes.  That&#x27;s pretty much the philosophy of Julia -- the prototype should be efficient.<p>But I see multiple challenges there for data science.  Even if you had distributed data frames, it wouldn&#x27;t solve that problem.  For one thing, most analysts don&#x27;t write their code with things like indices in mind, see my other comments here:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=15597376\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=15597376</a><p>If the code could benefit from indices, and is not using them (like most programs that use data frames), then IMO they need major surgery anyway.  It&#x27;s not just a matter of flipping a switch and magically going from small to big.  But yes I think the general idea of shipping your prototypes is appealing.", "parent": 15603682.0, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": null, "id": 15604170, "ranking": null, "date":

India &amp; China bought most of it at discount. It replaced some from the Persian Gulf which cost relatively more.<p>I want to identify the most significant switch patterns.<p>Since 2015, I record every global journey of a ship moving oil from one location to another.   Grouped as tuples: (month&#x2F;year, originCountry, destinationCountry, totalVolume)<p>Markets are constantly changing, switching patterns that made economic sense in 2015 might not make sense today, other patterns emerge.<p>Oil markets have trend-growth, and seasonal cycles. So these switches are not zero-sum actions, where an increase in X necessarily results in a decrease in Y.  Eg. China\u2019s refinery demand is growing, next month instead of increasing Persian Gulf imports by 100k bbls&#x2F;day,  maybe it only increases 40kbd, and instead takes an incremental 60kbd from North America.<p>The source data is very granular, so there are lots of minor, noisy movements that aren\u2019t meaningful.<p>Some countries are semi-groupable.  Many of countries in the PG export similar types&#x2F;prices of oil.<p>For each originCountry that sends oil to that destinationCountry,  calculate rolling average, and std-deviation of the imports over last N months.  Then  calculate the z-score for each monthly (date, origin, destination) tuple.<p>I then can try to look for sets of origins where  \u201cpostitive Z-scores for (originA, destinationX) are correlated with negative Z-scores (for orginB, destinationX)\u201d<p>These are subtle signals buried in a lot of noise.

His three reasons are true, but irrelevant, because the companies don&#x27;t even have to care how valuable the data is right now. It&#x27;s already free and clear, outside of maybe COPPA. It&#x27;s the territory of privacy that they have stored for anything they can think of in the future, while right now it&#x27;s fine to be used as an excuse to sell mundane ads based on it. I feel the regulation he desires is unlikely to happen because now the big data companies have more money than God, as well as much more focused interests than &quot;a group of Facebook users,&quot; and can use that money to lobby. All the while us mooks are left to set up GoFundMes and hashtags 8 years before someone, somewhere gets standing in court. If they get past arbitration, that is.[1]<p>There is effectively no consequence to any use or misuse of data on the ownership side and I don&#x27;t see that changing, not the least because data is the very lifeblood of the businesses that have been formed around it, it is the family jewels, and it will be protected from outside forces of all kinds. A data SarbOx isn&#x27;t going to be more effective than the ineffective original because nobody&#x27;s <i>really</i> going to tell them what they can do with their data. They have conquered frontiers of privacy, and we&#x27;re already on the way to a new regime oriented around them. Can they be beat back? Who knows.<p>This is why setting up what sounds essentially like an informational campaign that tells you that all this is happening is a bit of the old horse and barn door, and I&#x27;m pessimistic that they would ever run anything that might threaten the financial prospects of these companies.

Write a python script and use different tools like grep, cut etc within the script to get the data slice.

Then run grep on other files(using person_id if that is the foreign key in the other file or some other field from the result I got from previous grep).<p>Approach 1 will give the advantage of indexing in database which will make reading from tables faster.<p>On the other hand writing a python script will avoid the overhead of creating a database, storing all the data in the database and joining.<p>I&#x27;m not sure which his the best way to get better execution time for my requirement.

The general assumption about both intelligence and research was probably that they stick to rules and are concerned with their own fields.<p>I&#x27;d guess the average joe would (before snowden at least) think that an intelligence agency is concerned with foreign diplomats and military strategists and a political consultancy does opinion polls.<p>It&#x27;s something different if said agencies collect intimate data of random citizens without their consent. At least in public mind, that was something the stasi or similar organisations did - but certainly not their own side.", "parent": 16875156.0, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": null, "id": 16875319, "ranking": null, "date": 1524141321000, "year": 2018}, {"by": "RedTennisRacket", "score": null, "time": 1524149043, "timestamp": 1524149043000, "title": "", "type": "comment", "url": "", "text": "You raise several good points, but a few clarifications here:<p>- In our software that we deploy to police departments, generally the origin of any piece of information is tracked, as well as when it was entered and by who. The intention with this is to prevent this (and other) kinds of abuse. Malicious users can still abuse the system and do a parallel construction e.g. outside of our system or maybe in a way that the two actions (finding non-admissible data and finding admissible data) seem unrelated, but at that point they would be spending quite a bit of time and criminal energy on this. I don&#x27;t think this would happen commonly for a variety of practical reasons (but ultimately there&#x27;s no way to completely prevent it).<p>Ultimately trust in the government and that law enforcement (in the various shapes and forms it comes in) is a force for good and prevents many bad things from happening every single day, is at the heart of the palantir philosophy. If you fundamentally think the government is evil, palantir would probably not be the workplace for you. But once you see all of the bad things LE can prevent thanks to our software, it becomes pretty easy to believe in, even if individual bad actors exist (and always will), like racist cops, cops that abuse their power, etc.<p>- If the organization is acquiring warrantless surveillance, then this generally means that there is the legislative base for them to acquire the data in the first place. What this looks like varies from country to country, some countries are much stricter with the regulations than others. So for instance in some countries it is not allowed to get information from a suspects public facebook profile, whereas in other countries this is considered A-OK. Especially in europe these things have recently become much more strict with GDPR (and similar rules that apply to government entities). You&#x27;d think that be a downside to palantir (less data = less value?) but actually it&#x27;s a big business opportunity, because our software is the only thing available that is even remotely close in this space to having enough access control &#x27;finesse&#x27; that it can enable organizations to be compliant to this law. So this is an area (and competitive advantage) we are investing a lot into -- and typically organizations go from &#x27;completely non-compliant&#x27; when we arrive there (e.g. never even deleting data like license plates that are supposed to be deleted after 3 months etc, audit-logging any searches investigators do, limiting search scope, ...) to being fairly or even fully compliant.<p>Now my personal opinion is that everyone should be able to enjoy great privacy and control over their PII just like citizens of the EU do, so if you live e.g. in the US other another country where the law is lax, you should consider taking political action to change the situation.<p>Of course we never endorse or support any workflows that are in any way unconstitutional, and we have terminated relationships before with very big government agencies when we had doubt about whether our tools would be used for unlawful purposes.<p>- The &quot;big data&quot; thing is a bit of a misunderstanding I think -- we have &quot;big data&quot; tools too, but usually these are not of interest to local law enforcement. If you check out our youtube channel you will find some (atrociously old!) videos of the tool that&#x27;s popular in LLE (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=yMv3TBxulu4\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=yMv3TBxulu4</a> for instance). This tool is in fact often used with just hand-entered information -- analysts create objects (e.g. persons, links between them) in their investigation. So the data really isn&#x27;t that big and mostly hand-curated, and the tool works fine without mass data collection (better than with, perhaps). Most of what local law enforcement does with &#x27;big data&#x27; tools is to generate reports like crime statistics.<p>&quot;Police departments don&#x27;t just have random chunks of data lying around containing large numbers of connections between large numbers of people&quot; -- actually, they really do! Any police department of any size that has existed for a while will have a database with millions of convictions, suspects, court-cases etc in them. Usually on some crufty mainframe or in some crufty old SQL database that contains a lot of terribly inconsistent data (dead links, data duplication, etc.) Also sometimes some of this data is shared between countries, states etc. You can find some videos on youtube of our CEO talking about the challenges of data integration and such.<p>Ultimately of course there is a general statistical trend (belief?) that &#x27;more data is better&#x27;, because if there is more and more complete data, you have a bigger chance of finding that connection between e.g. a terrorist and some billionaire who might be funding said terrorists, etc. At least up until a point (at which the data probably becomes just too noisy&#x2F;hard to deal with, because every individual piece of information carries very little meaning. At least the NSA seems to subscribe to this belief according to their public statements, and I&#x27;d think if anyone knows about this stuff, it&#x27;s them) and assuming you have the necessary CPU power and talent (data scientists) to actually do something useful with this data. Local law enforcement orgs like police generally lack the latter. In police departments, most users are only sophisticated enough to run searches for things like names, SSN, number plates etc, really.<p>- We generally know a lot about how our software is used at most of our installations, and almost always actively take steps to prevent abuse (auditing etc). Most government organizations will not let us see things like what their analysts exactly searched for (because that is obviously sensitive information) but we do a lot of work to help organizations prevent abuse and insider threats at a higher level. As mentioned above, we have taken action in the past in situations where we suspected abuse. It&#x27;s on a case-by-case basis, of course -- imagine if there is e.g. one analyst abusing the system, then that analyst getting fired&#x2F;reprimanded would probably be sufficient action (obviously this is not in our responsibility), but if we suspect systematic abuse or we see signs of repeated abuse without repercussions, then we might pull out completely.", "parent": 16875382.0, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": null, "id": 16876291, "ranking": null, "date": 1524149043000, "year": 2018}, {"by": "EGreg", "score": 2.0, "time": 1524158961, "timestamp": 1524158961000, "title": "The genie is out of the bottle.

Big data is of course somewhat ambiguous nomenclature as well, but is nowadays typically understood to mean the Hadoop ecosystem or similar. Data is typically ingested into a distributed file system (HDFS, S3, etc.) in formats such as Parquet, Avro, JSON and often CSV. A schema-on-read database like Hive sits on top of this layer and presents a SQL interface to the user. Tools like Apache Spark provide programmatic transformations that operate on the data on the large.<p>CSV is often promoted as a format for storing structured data due to ease of ingestion and inspection (all you need is a text editor for troubleshooting). However, you pay a performance penalty every time an analytic query is run because CSV doesn&#x27;t support indexes, predicate pushdowns, compression, etc. and records can sometimes be uninterpretable under certain schemas (in which case they are simply excluded or dropped).<p>Sometimes having one too many commas in a row can completely mess things up (all the columns get shifted in a record) -- I found this out the hard way when Spark exported malformed CSVs with un-escaped commas.<p>[1] <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.pitneybowes.com&#x2F;SearchArticles&#x2F;VFP06_KnowledgeWithSidebarTroubleshoot?id=kA280000000TTCfCAO&amp;popup=false&amp;lang=en_US\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.pitneybowes.com&#x2F;SearchArticles&#x2F;VFP06_Knowledg...</a>", "parent": 16996922.0, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": null, "id": 16997730, "ranking": null, "date": 1525463825000, "year": 2018}, {"by": "mpweiher", "score": 4.0, "time": 1525475137, "timestamp": 1525475137000, "title": "Next Generation Indexes for Big Data Engineering (ODSC East 2018)", "type": "story", "url": "https://speakerdeck.com/lemire/next-generation-indexes-for-big-data-engineering-odsc-east-2018", "text": "", "parent": null, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": 0.0, "id": 16999149, "ranking": null, "date": 1525475137000, "year": 2018}, {"by": "doulcegee", "score": 3.0, "time": 1525520841, "timestamp": 1525520841000, "title": "7 OpenSource Big Data Business Intelligence Tools Your Business Can Benefit From", "type": "story", "url": "http://www.ultrabytes.org/global-market-is-getting-bigger-here-are-7-open-source-big-data-business-intelligence-tools-you-can-benefit-from-today/", "text": "", "parent": null, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": 0.0, "id": 17001411, "ranking": null, "date": 1525520841000, "year": 2018}, {"by": "peoplewindow", "score": null, "time": 1525679403, "timestamp": 1525679403000, "title": "", "type": "comment", "url": "", "text": "GOSPLAN didn&#x27;t fail because of lack of MapReduce.

It was good for a laugh, and there was a little bit of attention,  I mean, it was a grocery store in silicon valley.

I probably should have been ore precise with my language, though<p>So.. It&#x27;s well understood by True Scotsmen? :) I certainly understood that there are experts in the field who have a deep, even intuitive understanding of how and when to use which tools. To the extent that those experts don&#x27;t communicate that knowledge to a broader audience while at the same time may be advocating for the use of the tools, they bear some responsibility for the misuse.<p>My point wasn&#x27;t so much that you used imprecise, but rather, that the statement about how well it&#x27;s understood was inaccurate or irrelevant (depending on which definition you were going for).<p>&gt; But as a general rule of thumb, my feeling is that for tens to hundreds of GB, you should consider it. And for TBs or more, you almost certainly want to be doing something distributed<p>While a 3-4TB cutoff makes some sense if ones workload has to remain in-memory for performance reasons, that can&#x27;t be anywhere near the cutoff for any kind of workload that could stand to read from SSDs.<p>&gt; I don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s any resource out there that really goes deep into the tradeoffs involved though. There probably is, given how popular the subject is, but I&#x27;m not aware of one.<p>I would hope so, but I&#x27;m not so sure. It may not even need to be very deep, something akin to the &quot;5 minute rule&quot; for memory&#x2F;disk caching. Mostly, I&#x27;m not convinced that the subject of <i>tradeoffs</i> is actually popular, so much as just using the tool without considering them is.<p>&gt; The problem with the article is that if it&#x27;s for a general audience that doesn&#x27;t understand the tradeoffs of a system like Hadoop, it really paints a picture that it is just a bad, slow tool.<p>If we&#x27;re talking about the adamdrak.com 233x article, I have to disagree, as my read of it was that it focused on evangelizing the &quot;under-used approach for data processing&quot; of &quot;standard shell tools and commands&quot;.<p>&gt; it is peppered with unnecessarily snide comments about Hadoop that will probably be more memorable<p>That&#x27;s certainly not a charitable interpretation, and I would hazard that it&#x27;s not even fair or factual (as to &quot;peppered&quot;, at least). It&#x27;s mentioned only a handful of times:<p>&gt; Command-line Tools can be 235x Faster than your Hadoop Cluster<p>I agree that click-bait can be considered snide.<p>&gt; I was skeptical of using Hadoop for the task, but I can understand his goal of learning and having fun with mrjob and EMR<p>To me, this comment, this very first mention of Hadoop in the intro, made it clear that this was &quot;rigged&quot; in that the &quot;competition&quot; was neither competing nor truly concerned about performance.<p>&gt; while the Hadoop processing took about 26 minutes (processing speed of about 1.14MB&#x2F;sec).<p>Merely a factual summary. Nothing snide that I could detect.<p>&gt; Although Tom was doing the project for fun, often people use Hadoop and other so-called <i>Big Data</i> \u2122 tools for real-world processing and analysis jobs that can be done faster with simpler tools and different techniques.<p>This seems like just a restatement of the admission in the introduction plus the assertion (that I believe even you agree with) that many people mis-use Hadoop when it&#x27;s not called for.<p>&gt; The resulting stream processing pipeline we will create will be over 235 times faster than the Hadoop implementation and use virtually no memory.<p>Again, just another factual summary, with no snideness I could detect.<p>&gt; While we can certainly do better, assuming linear scaling this would have taken the Hadoop cluster approximately 52 minutes to process.<p>This next mention is after at least half of the bulk of the article. It may be an assuming-spherical-cows estimation, but it doesn&#x27;t strike me as grossly misleading on its face, and there&#x27;s no editorializing.<p>&gt; This gets us up to approximately 77 times faster than the Hadoop implementation.<p>&gt; about 174 times faster than the Hadoop implementation.<p>&gt; gets us down to a runtime of about 12 seconds, or about 270MB&#x2F;sec, which is around 235 times faster than the Hadoop implementation.<p>The next three mentions, near the end, are just comparisons of the evolving demonstration implementation to the reference implementation. No detectable snideness.<p>&gt; Hopefully this has illustrated some points about using and abusing tools like Hadoop<p>&gt; but more often than not these days I see Hadoop used<p>Here in the conclusion paragraph is where I agree that there is both snideness and where a reader may be confused about tradeoffs, if that&#x27;s what they were expecting to be enlightened about.<p>However, because that&#x27;s not what the introduction promised, my criticism would be merely that the conclusion doesn&#x27;t match the introduction (and maybe goes too far into inflammatory territory with &quot;abuses&quot;).<p>Pretend that section isn&#x27;t even in the article, and the article still reads OK.", "parent": 17494870.0, "deleted": null, "dead": null, "descendants": null, "id": 17495512, "ranking": null, "date": 1531197239000, "year": 2018}, {"by": "TeMPOraL", "score": null, "time": 1531198494, "timestamp": 1531198494000, "title": "", "type": "comment", "url": "", "text": "&gt; <i>They&#x27;re well understood by anyone who has used these technologies professionally.</i><p>We need to substitute the word &quot;professionally&quot; with more precise terms when talking about our industry.

AtScale has a large community of customers, partners and supporters who believe in the concept and have embraced the approached. Large mainstream publications like CIO Magazine are now urging tech leaders to look into the concept of a &quot;Universal Semantic Layer for Data&quot;.Do you feel you know what a &quot;Universal Semantic Layer for Data&quot; is ?! Well, if you don&#x27;t, you&#x27;re in for a treat. AtScale co-founder and CTO, Matt Baird, is running a power session next week to talk about the concept and the technical capabilities that define it. You can sign up for it here.<p>Prepare yourself...and prepare your questions\nIn preparation for the online session with Matt, I suggest you check out his blog and the CIO Magazine I mentioned earlier...and that you prepare your questions.

Things become more difficult as you go from one machine to many, so learn about parallel programming tactics like MapReduce[1] and Flume[2].<p>* Storing stuff is also much more difficult. You&#x27;ll either be working with distributed filesystems like GFS [3] or Colossus [4], NoSQL databases like bigtable [5], or SQL-like databases like Spanner [6] and F1 [7]<p>* Algorithms are tricky, because things that take no time at all on a single machine get to be very difficult when done on multiple machines. I don&#x27;t actually know of any resources on this one, but if you know the algorithms and learn distribution tactics like I outlined above, it should make more and more sense with practice.<p>* Finally, you need to know your operating systems and networks. What operations are cheap (RAM access, local disk access, most local computation, same-cluster network operations, streaming remote disk access) and what operations are expensive (longer network hops, random-access remote disk operations). You also should be able to ballpark (to an order of magnitude) things like latencies of operations, dataset sizes, QPS&#x27;s per machine, etc.<p>Also, when reading the papers, pay more attention to the interface than the implementation. One of the hardest things is transitioning from being spoiled by the local OS interface, where everything is cheap, to the distributed world, where seemingly random things are expensive or impossible.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;static.googleusercontent.com&#x2F;media&#x2F;research.google.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;&#x2F;archive&#x2F;mapreduce-osdi04.pdf\"

E.g., can train a network to recognize cats, dogs, and parrots or some such.<p>IMHO his material on <i>linearity</i> is somewhat interesting but avoids the common approach that what is <i>linear</i> is a function.  The usual definition goes, function f is <i>linear</i> provided<p>f(ax + by) = af(x) + bf(y)<p>for appropriate cases of a, b, x, y.  In linear algebra, commonly f is a matrix, a and b are numbers in a <i>field</i>, usually the real or complex numbers, and x and y are vectors.<p>Linearity continues quite broadly in math, especially analysis and geometry.  One text by G. F. Simmons stated that the two pillars of analysis in math were linearity and continuity.<p>It appears that after the first lecture, the course is heavily from a paper he and some others wrote on something of a software architecture to ease writing software for the computing for training neural networks.<p>His architecture is based on his definition of <i>associative arrays</i> which\nseem to be one, if you will, data structure which can take data from, be regarded as generalizations of, spreadsheets, matrices, maybe usually sparse, some graphs (that is, nodes connected by arcs), etc.  For the associative arrays, he defines operations that generalize addition and multiplication of matrix theory, etc. and shows that the operations obey a distributive law that he regards as the key to linearity.<p>Then the general, infrastructure (interface) software <i>layer</i> is supposed to be small and easy to write.<p>Some of his examples of anomaly detection from &quot;big data&quot; (it really was big) are impressive.<p>His framework might significantly help the productivity of building and using neural networks.<p>First cut, it looks like the main interests in neural networks have been for recognition of speech and images, but his examples likely provide good evidence of other significant application areas.<p>As might expect from Lincoln Labs, he&#x27;s fully serious and not just fooling around or pushing hype.<p>His lecture notes and writing are relatively good.<p>He has a textbook available at Amazon.<p>For just the course materials, he has a ZIP file download of  35,802,178 bytes that from just one use of a standard UNZIP command expands into about 640 files&#x2F;directories (the number of files&#x2F;directories of his course on my disk is 640 and nearly all of those are from the UNZIP command).

However, the area of cybersecurity has not embraced it so much, and the advantages of big data analytics are now also explored in this area. The Hadoop and BI tools that are available in the market can be useful in curbing the security challenges with the analytics of big data in companies and industries.
